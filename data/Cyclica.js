Using pre-computed, multi-scale structural proteomics databases that are representative of conditions in the human body at 37C, the platform accurately identifies problematic protein-drug interactions that result in side effects and toxicity.</p>\n\n<p>The technology can predict safety profiles of drugs in a faster, more accurate way than other approaches. The range of patented algorithms indexes biological big data and generates biologically relevant structural proteomics information. As opposed to other in-silico models, our proprietary process is not limited to using existing outcomes data, but is a holistic virtual system that identifies as yet unobserved drug-protein interactions. </p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 43], "assets/images/resized/0029/8138/298138v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 71], "assets/images/resized/0029/8138/298138v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 129], "assets/images/resized/0029/8138/298138v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Tue Jul 30 23:19:31 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "j.mitakidis@cyclicarx.com", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Jason", "last_name": "Mitakidis", "permalink": "jason-mitakidis"}, "title": "President, CEO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Kate", "last_name": "Rootman", "permalink": "kate-rootman"}, "title": "VP Marketing"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Mickael", "last_name": "Krzeminski", "permalink": "mickael-krzeminski"}, "title": "Scientific Director"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Makarand", "last_name": "Jawadekar", "permalink": "makarand-jawadekar"}, "title": "Board Member"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [], "founded_day": 30, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [{"is_past": false, "provider": {"permalink": "jeremy-grushcow-b-sc-ph-d-j-d", "name": "Jeremy Grushcow (B.Sc., Ph.D., J.D.)"}, "title": "Legal"}], "offices": [{"city": "", "description": "Toronto Office", "address1": "", "address2": "", "longitude": null, "country_code": "CAN", "latitude": null, "state_code": null, "zip_code": ""}], "phone_number": "", "description": "Big Data Drug Discovery", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "cyclica", "milestones": [], "external_links": [{"title": "Canadian university team wins global business prize", "external_url": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-tools/small-business-briefing/canadian-university-team-wins-global-business-prize/article12063877/"}, {"title": "Cyclica and Dalton Announce Collaboration Agreement to Identify and Develop New Drug Candidates", "external_url": "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/4/prweb10617530.htm"}, {"title": "Cyclica Inc.
