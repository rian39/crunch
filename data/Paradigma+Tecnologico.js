However, all of them have a common characteristic; they are conceptualized and carried out to fit the individual needs and requirements of the client. See more</p>\n\n<p>Web Applications\nEach Web application developed by Paradigma is the subject of an initial study, which allow us to select the technology development framework both for back end and front end, as well as to choose from pure rich web interfaces in Ajax to interfaces which are rich in some cases, with Flex or other technologies, or in special cases slightly heavier. See more</p>\n\n<p>Semantic Technology\nAs if we didn\u2019t have enough with Web 2.0, now we go even further and we are raising the level. We already have Web 3.0!!!!!! Apart from being trendy, what we want to achieve with Web 3.0 is solving the problems of unstructured information overload in the network. How? See more</p>\n\n<p>Mobility\nWho has not heard of the iPhone, or more recently of the Nexus One, the Google phone with Android OS, or even the famous BlackBerrys? The introduction of these phones on the market and the improvement of the 3G networks completely changed the experience of connecting your mobile to internet. See more</p>\n\n<p>Paradigma Clinic\nWhy not use all our knowledge acquired over the years to engage our clients in our best practices?. Our Clinic offers audit and training services with a global vision focused on systems and people, as we believe that both should go together, to offer value added services to our clients. From Clinic we have a practical orientation, trying to solve real and tangible problems. See more</p>\n\n<p>And all this\nWe can do well in the classic format of Closed Deal but as well, we can either make you a consultancy or we can create a training course focused on your application.
