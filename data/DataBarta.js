Consumers are increasingly wary of what happens to their data; 2. markets are changing - IoT is seeing vertical markets become horizontal requiring companies to access data outside their existing customer bases to be competitive and succeed.</p>\n\n<p>DataBarta is a data broker and market platform - it provides consumers with transparency and the ability to monetise their data, whilst providing companies with greater access without having to individually negotiate access and meet regulatory privacy compliance. </p>\n\n<p>We are initially launching in the UK energy data market - able to provide a better alternative than the government appointed Data Communications Company in being live in 3 months rather than 2 years, able to obtain informed opt-in consent on behalf of companies, able to provide near real-time data access, able to provide consumers with a central console to view and manage data requests, able to store data long term.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[148, 43], "assets/images/resized/0033/9639/339639v1-max-150x150.jpg"], [[148, 43], "assets/images/resized/0033/9639/339639v1-max-250x250.jpg"], [[148, 43], "assets/images/resized/0033/9639/339639v1-max-450x450.jpg"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Wed Oct 09 16:21:54 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "contact@databarta.com", "alias_list": "", "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Jane", "last_name": "Lucy", "permalink": "jane-lucy"}, "title": "CEO"}], "partners": [{"link_2_url": null, "partner_name": "AngelList", "link_1_url": "https://angel.co/databarta-ltd?utm_source=crunchbase&utm_medium=link&utm_content=profile&utm_term=databarta&utm_campaign=crunchbase", "link_3_url": null, "link_3_name": null, "homepage_url": "http://private beta available on request", "link_1_name": "AngelList Page", "link_2_name": null}], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[150, 76], "assets/images/resized/0033/8969/338969v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 128], "assets/images/resized/0033/8969/338969v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 230], "assets/images/resized/0033/8969/338969v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, {"available_sizes": [[[150, 87], "assets/images/resized/0033/8970/338970v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 145], "assets/images/resized/0033/8970/338970v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 262], "assets/images/resized/0033/8970/338970v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [], "phone_number": "", "description": "Unlocking internet of things data.", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "databarta", "milestones": [], "external_links": [{"title": "Shortlisted CIsco BIG Awards", "external_url": "http://www.computerweekly.com/photostory/2240204024/Introducing-the-BIG-Awards-semi-finalists/7/DataBarta-democratising-data"}, {"title": "Cisco BIG Awards", "external_url": "http://www.computerweekly.com/photostory/2240204024/Introducing-the-BIG-Awards-semi-finalists/7/DataBarta-democratising-data"}], "number_of_employees": null, "founded_year": 2013, "founded_month": null, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "databarta", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "DataBarta", "created_at": "Tue Jul 30 08:45:33 UTC 2013", "homepage_url": "", "products": [], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "big-data, internet-of-things, m2m", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
