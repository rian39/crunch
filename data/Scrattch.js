The future lies in the interest graph and in an individuals ability to tap into someone else\u2019s research. Facebook is losing its shine, users are no longer interested in what their neighbor had for breakfast or how many medals their cousin received at soccer camp. Users are wanting content. Good content. Great content. They are looking for fast and reliable updates about topics of interest. Things that mean something to them and areas of interest. Ideas. Progress. Change. What is happening in areas that are meaningful to their lives. Whether this be the latest technology updates or new techniques in growing tomatoes. </p>\n\n<p>More than one billion new pages are added to the Internet each day. In just 60 seconds more than 1500 blog posts, 600 YouTube videos and 6,600 Flickr photos are added to the net. We want to cut through the bull and find the bits that fuel us. The topics that make our lives richer. The snipits of information that make us stronger, wiser and better able to navigate our own lives. </p>\n\n<p>Whether our community simply means those we know offline, in a club or organization or social setting or within a wider online community that we have come to trust- crowdsourcing for knowledge is a powerful tool that enables users to gain access to the information that matters most to them. </p>\n\n<p>It is about building communities, not isolating ourselves from them.</p>\n\n<p>Its is about creating groups, collaborating, sharing. Not trusting in large corporates to give us the information we desire.</p>\n\n<p>It is about disrupting the status quo when it comes to accessing information online. Its about peeling back the layers and bringing a human element back to our search for knowledge and current information that will make our lives better. </p>\n\n<p>Scrattch brings people together over common interests and not common friends. It is our mission is to create context and meaning around data through crowdsourcing for knowledge. </p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 150], "assets/images/resized/0033/3218/333218v2-max-150x150.jpg"], [[250, 250], "assets/images/resized/0033/3218/333218v2-max-250x250.jpg"], [[267, 267], "assets/images/resized/0033/3218/333218v2-max-450x450.jpg"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Fri Sep 27 13:02:52 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "whoisscrattch@scrattch.com", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Louise", "last_name": "Donnelly-Davey", "permalink": "louise-donnelly-davey"}, "title": "Founder/ CEO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Matt", "last_name": "Tester", "permalink": "matt-tester"}, "title": "Developer"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Chris", "last_name": "Rae", "permalink": "chris-rae"}, "title": "Developer"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Colin", "last_name": "Burns", "permalink": "colin-burns-2"}, "title": "Developer"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[150, 106], "assets/images/resized/0033/3214/333214v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 178], "assets/images/resized/0033/3214/333214v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 320], "assets/images/resized/0033/3214/333214v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, {"available_sizes": [[[150, 107], "assets/images/resized/0033/3215/333215v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 178], "assets/images/resized/0033/3215/333215v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 321], "assets/images/resized/0033/3215/333215v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, {"available_sizes": [[[150, 102], "assets/images/resized/0033/3216/333216v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 170], "assets/images/resized/0033/3216/333216v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 306], "assets/images/resized/0033/3216/333216v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, {"available_sizes": [[[100, 150], "assets/images/resized/0033/3217/333217v2-max-150x150.png"], [[166, 250], "assets/images/resized/0033/3217/333217v2-max-250x250.png"], [[300, 450], "assets/images/resized/0033/3217/333217v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [{"competitor": {"permalink": "delicious", "name": "delicious"}}, {"competitor": {"permalink": "evernote", "name": "Evernote"}}, {"competitor": {"permalink": "facebook", "name": "Facebook"}}, {"competitor": {"permalink": "kippt", "name": "Kippt"}}, {"competitor": {"permalink": "pocket", "name": "Pocket"}}], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [{"is_past": false, "provider": {"permalink": "johnson-prichard-fee", "name": "Johnson Prichard Fee"}, "title": "Legal"}], "offices": [{"city": "Queenstown", "description": "PO Box 2245", "address1": "Wakatipu", "address2": "", "longitude": null, "country_code": "NZL", "latitude": null, "state_code": null, "zip_code": "9304"}], "phone_number": "64 27 2020 934", "description": "Crowdsourcing Knowledge ", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "scrattchsearch", "milestones": [], "external_links": [{"title": "Kiwi Start Up Selected for Global List ", "external_url": "http://unlimited.co.nz/unlimited.nsf/startup/kiwi-startup-selected-for-promising-ventures-list"}, {"title": "Scrattch- One of worlds most innovative companies", "external_url": "http://www.thenextwomen.com/2012/10/23/story-scrattch-one-worlds-most-innovative-startups"}, {"title": "Female Founder/CEO makes top 50 list ", "external_url": "http://www.women2.com/female-founded-new-zealand-startup-scrattch-makes-gew-50-finalist/"}, {"title": "Blog response to Vinod Khosla- Microsoft Bizspark", "external_url": "http://blogs.technet.com/b/bizspark_group_blog/archive/2012/09/18/40-year-old-female-seeks-happiness-finds-it-in-startup-guest-blog-by-scrattch-founder-louise-donnelly-davey.aspx"}], "number_of_employees": 3, "founded_year": 2012, "founded_month": 10, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "scrattch", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "Scrattch", "created_at": "Fri Oct 19 04:09:41 UTC 2012", "homepage_url": "http://www.scrattch.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "interest-graph, collaboration, social-networking, big-data, developer-apis", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
