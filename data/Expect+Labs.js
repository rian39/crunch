MindMeld was selected as \u201cBest in Show\u201d at the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show and was featured by Popular Science as one of the \u201cHottest Gadgets\u201d of 2013. Gartner recognized Expect Labs as one of their &#8220;Cool Vendors of 2013,&#8221; and they were selected as a finalist for the 2013 CODiE Award for best mobile device application. They were also finalists at the 2012 TechCrunch Disrupt startup competition, the 2013 CES Mobile App Showdown, and the 2013 SXSW Innovative Technology Accelerator.</p>\n\n<p>Expect Labs is the creator of the MindMeld app and API. The MindMeld app is the first intelligent assistant that can understand your conversations and find information you need before you have to search for it. The MindMeld API is an advanced developer platform and cloud-based service to power a new generation of anticipatory computing applications.</p>\n\n<p>Expect Labs was founded in 2011 by successful, repeat entrepreneurs, and the team includes PhDs and world-class researchers from places like the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and Bell Labs. Expect Labs is backed by some of Silicon Valley&#8217;s most well-known investors and some of the technology industry&#8217;s largest and most influential companies, including Google, Samsung, Intel, Telef\u00f3nica, Liberty Global, Greylock Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners, IDG Ventures, KPG Ventures, Quest Venture Partners, and several prominent angels.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes":
