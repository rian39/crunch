We have developed a product that is optimized for Big Data &amp; NoSQL workloads. We see that Hadoop &amp; Big Data analytics are under constant pressure to improve performance with a minimum change in cost. In this environment, continuous &amp; exponential data growth has made storage a constant bottleneck. We have developed an innovative Flash memory based architecture that delivers a 10X performance improvement at hard disk costs, while maintaining complete transparency and yet delivering an extensible architecture that is tune-able to the Big Data workloads.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 22], "assets/images/resized/0035/7755/357755v2-max-150x150.jpg"], [[250, 36], "assets/images/resized/0035/7755/357755v2-max-250x250.jpg"], [[450, 66], "assets/images/resized/0035/7755/357755v2-max-450x450.jpg"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Sat Nov 16 05:52:08 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "info@argildata.com", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [], "partners": [], "screenshots": [], "founded_day": 3, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Santa Clara", "description": "Argil Data Corp", "address1": "2901 Tasman Drive", "address2": "Suite 107", "longitude": null, "country_code": "USA", "latitude": null, "state_code": "CA", "zip_code": "95054"}], "phone_number": "", "description": "Application aware storage", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "", "milestones": [], "external_links": [{"title": "", "external_url": "http://www.argildata.com"}], "number_of_employees": 8, "founded_year": 2013, "founded_month": 10, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "argil-data-corp", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "Argil Data Corp", "created_at": "Tue Nov 12 21:20:49 UTC 2013", "homepage_url": "http://www.argildata.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "big-data, storage, flash, data, ssd, memory, analytics, application-aware, application-aware-storage, software-defined-storage, nosql, hadoop, hdfs, mongodb, cassandra, hbase, real-time-analytics, shared-storage", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
