Every time a Veeip user shops at one of those places with a linked card, the transaction will be matched by Veeip, so that, when they qualify for a reward, the value of that reward is automatically paid back onto their card without them having to do anything.  </p>\n\n<p>Veeip takes away the need for shoppers to use loyalty cards or vouchers and offers them a frictionless solution for being rewarded for good custom.</p>\n\n<p>Veeip captures the financial transaction and epos data between registered users and their Veeip Places. This data is turned into analytics that can be used on behalf of each participating Veeip Place to micro-tailor offers to Veeip users. </p>\n\n<p>Veeip users will also be able to see extracts of their own shopping data on their app. </p>\n\n<p>Users can currently pre-register for the Veeip app at veeip.com, prior to its launch early 2014. Those users are encouraged to vote for the places they want to see on the Veeip app. </p>", "image": null, "updated_at": "Mon Nov 18 13:03:46 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [{"investments": [], "funded_month": 6, "source_description": "", "round_code": "seed", "raised_amount": null, "source_url": "", "raised_currency_code": "USD", "funded_year": 2013, "funded_day": null, "id": 54610}], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "veeiphq@veeip.com", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Aly", "last_name": "Karim", "permalink": "aly-karim"}, "title": "CEO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Louis-Alex", "last_name": "Meslier", "permalink": "louis-alex-meslier"}, "title": "CTO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Liz", "last_name": "Smith", "permalink": "liz-smith"}, "title": "CMO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Nik", "last_name": "Chotai", "permalink": "nik-chotai"}, "title": "CFO"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Pinner", "description": "Head Office", "address1": "Westbury House", "address2": "23-25 Bridge Street", "longitude": null, "country_code": "GBR", "latitude": null, "state_code": null, "zip_code": "HA5 3HR"}], "phone_number": "+44 20 3291 2880", "description": "Europe Card Linked Offers", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "veeippower", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": null, "founded_year": null, "founded_month": null, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "veeip", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "Veeip", "created_at": "Wed Nov 13 15:42:00 UTC 2013", "homepage_url": "http://veeip.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "http://www.veeip.com/blog/", "tag_list": "clo, card-linked-loyalty, big-data, analytics, mobile-app, uk, frictionless-commerce", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
