The algorithms then search the entire Internet for concepts with similar structural components, and return those results from entirely new domains. </p>\n\n<p>These metaphorical links between concepts, or lateral connections, create new value by working across boundaries, rather than within a closed domain or discipline. The tool is for anyone who is working on the edge of knowledge of their field, looking to generate new ideas or to see their problem or topic in a new light, from Designers and Artists to Inventors, Engineers, Scientists, and Businessmen.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[100, 100], "assets/images/resized/0020/8890/208890v4-max-150x150.png"], [[100, 100], "assets/images/resized/0020/8890/208890v4-max-250x250.png"], [[100, 100], "assets/images/resized/0020/8890/208890v4-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Wed Sep 25 07:26:16 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "hello@yossarianlives.com", "alias_list": "", "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Daniel", "last_name": "Foster-Smith", "permalink": "daniel-foster-smith"}, "title": "Co-founder, CTO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "J.", "last_name": "Paul Neeley", "permalink": "j-paul-neeley"}, "title": "Co-founder, CEO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Ekaterina", "last_name": "Shutova", "permalink": "ekaterina-shutova"}, "title": "Chief Scientist and Co-Founder"}], "partners": [{"link_2_url": null, "partner_name": "AngelList", "link_1_url": "https://angel.co/yossarianlives?utm_source=crunchbase&utm_medium=link&utm_content=profile&utm_term=yossarianlives&utm_campaign=crunchbase", "link_3_url": null, "link_3_name": null, "homepage_url": "http://www.yossarianlives.com", "link_1_name": "AngelList Page", "link_2_name": null}], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[150, 82], "assets/images/resized/0031/7377/317377v1-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 137], "assets/images/resized/0031/7377/317377v1-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 246], "assets/images/resized/0031/7377/317377v1-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [], "phone_number": "", "description": "a Metaphorical Search Engine", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "yssrnlvs", "milestones": [], "external_links": [{"title": "Search the metaphorical Google with YossarianLives", "external_url": "http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/05/play/the-metaphorical-google"}, {"title": "Metaphorical search engine finds creative new meanings", "external_url": "http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328536.500-metaphorical-search-engine-finds-creative-new-meanings.html"}], "number_of_employees": 11, "founded_year": 2011, "founded_month": null, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "yossarianlives", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "YossarianLives", "created_at": "Thu Aug 30 09:25:30 UTC 2012", "homepage_url": "http://www.yossarianlives.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "http://blog.yossarianlives.com", "tag_list": "search, big-data, metaphor, discovery, analytics", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
