That team now includes ex-Google and Palantir engineer Justin Legakis and former Luvocracy product head Andrew Holt.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, Moju Labs wants to do more than just automatically \u2013 or automagically \u2013 organize and manage your photo collection. That would be only one piece to its overall vision. Photos are a starting point, but the company plans to eventually support all your personal data, then create a system you can query using natural language.</p>\n\n<p>So imagine that, one day, you could simply ask the service to tell you a story about a time when your family was on vacation, and everyone was happy. That sort of advanced query is Moju Labs\u2019 end goal.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 96], "assets/images/resized/0026/5625/265625v5-max-150x150.png"], [[155, 100], "assets/images/resized/0026/5625/265625v5-max-250x250.png"], [[155, 100], "assets/images/resized/0026/5625/265625v5-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Mon Nov 11 01:42:16 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "", "alias_list": "", "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Mok", "last_name": "Oh", "permalink": "mok-oh"}, "title": "Co-Founder and CEO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Justin", "last_name": "Legakis", "permalink": "justin-legakis"}, "title": "Co-Founder and CTO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Andrew", "last_name": "Holt", "permalink": "andrew-holt"}, "title": ""}], "partners": [{"link_2_url": null, "partner_name": "AngelList", "link_1_url": "https://angel.co/moju-labs?utm_source=crunchbase&utm_medium=link&utm_content=profile&utm_term=moju-labs&utm_campaign=crunchbase", "link_3_url": null, "link_3_name": null, "homepage_url": "http://mojulabs.com", "link_1_name": "AngelList Page", "link_2_name": null}], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[150, 114], "assets/images/resized/0026/5624/265624v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 190], "assets/images/resized/0026/5624/265624v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 342], "assets/images/resized/0026/5624/265624v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "San Francisco", "description": "", "address1": "", "address2": "", "longitude": null, "country_code": "USA", "latitude": null, "state_code": "CA", "zip_code": ""}], "phone_number": "", "description": "Online Photo Storing", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "mojulabs", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": 10, "founded_year": 2013, "founded_month": 3, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "moju-labs", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "Moju Labs", "created_at": "Wed May 22 18:44:56 UTC 2013", "homepage_url": "http://www.mojulabs.com/", "products": [], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "social-media, photography, big-data", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
