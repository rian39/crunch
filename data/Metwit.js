Metwit APIs allow developers to create geolocalized applications capable of receiving and publishing diffused, real time environmental data with a strong social connotation.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 75], "assets/images/resized/0022/1692/221692v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 126], "assets/images/resized/0022/1692/221692v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 227], "assets/images/resized/0022/1692/221692v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Wed Dec 12 07:48:12 UTC 2012", "funding_rounds": [{"investments": [{"person": null, "company": null, "financial_org": {"permalink": "seedstartup", "name": "Seedstartup"}}], "funded_month": 8, "source_description": "Meet the first three startups from the Middle East incubator \u2018SeedStartup\u2019s\u2019 pilot program", "round_code": "seed", "raised_amount": 25000.0, "source_url": "http://thenextweb.com/me/2012/01/29/meet-the-first-three-startups-from-the-middle-east-incubator-seedstartups-pilot-program/", "raised_currency_code": "USD", "funded_year": 2012, "funded_day": 30, "id": 33862}], "total_money_raised": "$25k", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "mike@metwit.com", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Simone", "last_name": "D'Amico", "permalink": "simone-damico"}, "title": "Founder"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Davide", "last_name": "Rizzo", "permalink": "davide-rizzo"}, "title": "Founder"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[150, 51], "assets/images/resized/0022/1066/221066v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 85], "assets/images/resized/0022/1066/221066v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 154], "assets/images/resized/0022/1066/221066v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": 4, "competitions": [{"competitor": {"permalink": "wunderground", "name": "wunderground"}}], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "LONDON", "description": "Company address", "address1": "471 FINCHLEY ROAD", "address2": "", "longitude": -0.1892311, "country_code": "GBR", "latitude": 51.5530545, "state_code": null, "zip_code": "NW3 6HS"}], "phone_number": "", "description": "Everyone is a sensor", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "howdyclowdy", "milestones": [], "external_links": [{"title": "Betakit on Crowdsourced weather", "external_url": "http://betakit.com/2012/10/20/apps-taking-a-crowdsourced-approach-to-reporting-the-weather"}], "number_of_employees": 4, "founded_year": 2012, "founded_month": 4, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "metwit", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "Metwit", "created_at": "Mon Nov 19 18:25:43 UTC 2012", "homepage_url": "http://metwit.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "http://blog.metwit.com", "tag_list": "weather, big-data, crowdsourced, social", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
