We connect vibration and ultrasonic sensors to smartphones and pair them with Machine Learning algorithms. \nBasically, we\u2019re like Shazam - but for engines.</p>\n\n<p>Our technology can be used across the board \u2013 from industrial factories all the way to your home, where you have your washing machines, dishwashers and air-conditioners.</p>\n\n<p>Our vision is to be inside every thing that has moving parts - to become the back-end of machine diagnostics in the Internet-of-Things. Our first market is Commercial Buildings HVAC.</p>\n\n<p>With upcoming pilots with three of the largest building service companies in the U.S., Augury is the only viable solution for commercial building maintenance to date, with a potential $20B yearly market. We already have \ufb01ve systems deployed in the U.S. and a number of success stories behind us.</p>", "image": null, "updated_at": "Fri Oct 11 17:26:50 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "info@augurysystems.com", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Saar", "last_name": "Yoskovitz", "permalink": "saar-yoskovitz"}, "title": "Co-Founder, CEO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Gal", "last_name": "Shaul", "permalink": "gal-shaul"}, "title": "Co-Founder, CTO"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[150, 136], "assets/images/resized/0033/1554/331554v2-max-150x150.jpg"], [[250, 227], "assets/images/resized/0033/1554/331554v2-max-250x250.jpg"], [[450, 409], "assets/images/resized/0033/1554/331554v2-max-450x450.jpg"]], "attribution": null}, {"available_sizes": [[[109, 150], "assets/images/resized/0033/1555/331555v2-max-150x150.jpg"], [[183, 250], "assets/images/resized/0033/1555/331555v2-max-250x250.jpg"], [[329, 450], "assets/images/resized/0033/1555/331555v2-max-450x450.jpg"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [{"is_past": false, "provider": {"permalink": "yigal-arnon-co", "name": "Yigal Arnon & Co "}, "title": "Corporate law"}, {"is_past": false, "provider": {"permalink": "ernst-young", "name": "Ernst & Young"}, "title": "Accountants"}, {"is_past": false, "provider": {"permalink": "pczl-law", "name": "PCZL law"}, "title": "IP Firm"}], "offices": [], "phone_number": "", "description": "Machines talk, We listen.", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": 5, "founded_year": 2013, "founded_month": 4, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "augury-systems", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "Augury Systems", "created_at": "Tue Sep 24 09:49:32 UTC 2013", "homepage_url": "http://augurysystems.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "predictive-maintenance, internet-of-things, internet-of-everything, predictive-modeling, big-data, crowdsource, energy-saving", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
