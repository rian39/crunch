Generally, CPI campaigns on appbackr are more affordable than ad networks. </p>\n\n<p>appbackr\u2019s smartApps algorithm enables the discovery of the most promising new apps and sleeper apps at the tipping point of success with predictive analytics. smartApps has insight into what does and doesn\u2019t convert to traffic and sales.</p>\n\n<p>The algorithm identifies the apps that will be most successful for a specific market and distributes apps to the most appropriate retail channels and target audiences based on that data. </p>\n\n<p>The appbackr appscore gives every Android app a score from 1.0-10.0. The score is based on data gather from the Google Play store:\n&gt;customer reviews: sentiment analysis, addictive reviews, crash reviews\n&gt;sales\n&gt;marketability\n &gt;Crash Index by Device\n &gt;Rank\n &gt;Week-over-week sales progress</p>\n\n<p>The appscore uses a machine-learning model, evolving and adapting to changing conditions, exploiting hidden correlations in the large and complex mobile app market. </p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 39], "assets/images/resized/0009/4625/94625v5-max-150x150.png"], [[201, 53], "assets/images/resized/0009/4625/94625v5-max-250x250.png"], [[201, 53], "assets/images/resized/0009/4625/94625v5-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Tue Apr 09 13:33:27 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [{"investments": [{"person": null, "company": null, "financial_org": {"permalink": "svase-cambridge-west-ventures", "name": "SVASE/Cambridge West Ventures"}}], "funded_month": 4, "source_description": "Local startups win seed funding and a wealth of knowledge, SEC", "round_code": "seed", "raised_amount": 50000.0, "source_url": "http://www.examiner.com/x-33267-San-Jose-Web-20-Examiner~y2010m4d7-Local-startups-win-seed-funding-and-a-wealth-of-knowledge", "raised_currency_code": "USD", "funded_year": 2010, "funded_day": 7, "id": 13861}, {"investments": [], "funded_month": 7, "source_description": "appbackr Receives Third Major Award as AlwaysOn Global 250 Winner, Closes Oversubscribed Seed Funding Round", "round_code": "seed", "raised_amount": 600000.0, "source_url": "http://ipcommunications.tmcnet.com/news/2010/07/22/4915786.htm", "raised_currency_code": "USD", "funded_year": 2010, "funded_day": 22, "id": 17206}], "total_money_raised": "$650k", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "admin@appbackr.com", "alias_list": "", "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Nathan", "last_name": "Beckord", "permalink": "nathan-beckord"}, "title": "Co-founder and Advisor"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Trevor", "last_name": "Cornwell", "permalink": "trevor-cornwell"}, "title": "Founder & CEO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Sam", "last_name": "Zappas", "permalink": "sam-zappas"}, "title": "Co-founder"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Matthew", "last_name": "M.
