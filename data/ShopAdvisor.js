For publishers, ShopAdvisor closes the loop between media and retail, deepening reader engagement, enhancing advertising ROI and generating new revenue.</p>\n\n<p>ShopAdvisor is the only platform designed around this natural shopping behavior. Consumer\u2019s simply \u201cwatch\u201d products they\u2019ve discovered. Later, when the time is right, or when the price is right, ShopAdvisor reminds them \u2013 on their phone, in their email, on their tablet.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011, the development team delivered an application for iOS based on the ShopAdvisor deferred purchasing back end platform. The iPhone application received the App Store Rewind Best Utility App of 2011. ShopAdvisor is also available as a service embedded within third party apps, including leading tablet editions of digital magazines and on web sites.</p>\n\n<p>Founded in 2011, ShopAdvisor (formerly known as Evoqu) is based in Boston, MA.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 150], "assets/images/resized/0015/6472/156472v9-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 250],
