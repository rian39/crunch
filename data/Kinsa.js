With it, we will empower society with information to track the spread of disease, and simultaneously transform the way people care for their children, families and communities. </p>\n\n<p>Our first product is a low-cost smartphone-connected thermometer. It allows us to communicate with people who have just fallen ill. The world\u2019s smartest thermometer, it does not simply tell you your temperature, rather it transform the way you care for your family. You can track your symptoms with a few simple taps to show your doctor later, view the \u201chealth weather\u201d in the local area or at your child&#8217;s school, and know whether it&#8217;s strep or flu going around, or book a medical appointment. It is also a better thermometer. We designed it specifically with children and parents in mind. Using the smartphone&#8217;s display, we have created an engaging experience potentially making it easier to take a sick child&#8217;s temperature. </p>\n\n<p>Members of our team previously built international health programs that put more than 2 million people onto life-saving treatments and started successful technology ventures.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 56], "assets/images/resized/0025/0453/250453v7-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 94], "assets/images/resized/0025/0453/250453v7-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 169], "assets/images/resized/0025/0453/250453v7-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Fri Aug 16 09:57:03 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [{"investments": [{"person": null, "company": null, "financial_org": {"permalink": "ia-ventures", "name": "IA Ventures"}}, {"person": null, "company": null, "financial_org": {"permalink": "founder-collective", "name": "Founder Collective"}}, {"person": {"first_name": "Andy", "last_name": "Palmer", "permalink": "andy-palmer-2"}, "company": null, "financial_org": null}, {"person": {"first_name": "Ed", "last_name": "Park", "permalink": "ed-park"}, "company": null, "financial_org": null}], "funded_month": 8, "source_description": "", "round_code": "seed", "raised_amount": 2000000.0, "source_url": "", "raised_currency_code": "USD", "funded_year": 2012, "funded_day": 14, "id": 37329}], "total_money_raised": "$2M", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "social@kinsahealth.com", "alias_list": "", "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Inder", "last_name": "Singh", "permalink": "inder-singh"}, "title": "Founder & CEO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Gaurav", "last_name": "Jain", "permalink": "gaurav-jain-2"}, "title": ""}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[150, 85], "assets/images/resized/0025/2199/252199v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 142], "assets/images/resized/0025/2199/252199v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 256], "assets/images/resized/0025/2199/252199v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": 27, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "New York", "description": "New York", "address1": "603 Greenwich St,", "address2": "#101B", "longitude": -74.0082188, "country_code": "USA", "latitude": 40.7298056, "state_code": "NY", "zip_code": "10014"}], "phone_number": "6463807250", "description": "Creating a real-time map of human health", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "kinsahealth", "milestones": [], "external_links": [{"title": "Kinsa launches a smartphone-connected thermometer to create a real-time health map", "external_url": "http://gigaom.com/2013/04/17/kinsa-launches-a-smartphone-connected-thermometer-to-create-a-real-time-health-map/"}, {"title": "Health and Tech Entrepreneurs Unite to Create Real-Time Map of Health; Stop the Spread of Communicable Illness", "external_url": "http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130417-907581.html?mod=googlenews_wsj"}, {"title": "Kinsa starts with thermometer, works up to realtime health map", "external_url": "http://mobihealthnews.com/21705/kinsa-starts-with-thermometer-works-up-to-realtime-health-map/"}], "number_of_employees": null, "founded_year": 2012, "founded_month": 3, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "kinsa", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "Kinsa", "created_at": "Thu Apr 11 01:16:25 UTC 2013", "homepage_url": "http://www.kinsahealth.com", "products": [{"permalink": "kinsa-smart-thermometer", "name": "Kinsa Smart Thermometer"}], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "mobile-health, big-data, medical-devices, health-and-wellness", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
