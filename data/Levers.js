But because there aren\u2019t enough hours in the day to parse all the data you\u2019re collecting, let alone act on any conclusions you might draw, staying ahead of the curve is almost impossible. Instead of just jumping into the mess, use Levers to find your fulcrum.</p>\n\n<p>From a single platform, Levers mathematically presents a calculated data analysis of your quantitative marketing efforts. After assessing your data with the campaign goals you designate, Levers simulates adjustments to your performance marketing and organic efforts, giving you an intelligent, calculated advice. </p>\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019re focused on marketing ROI, optimized budgets or leveraged return on engagement, Levers does the hardest work for you. The predictive analytics dashboard automatically pivots your KPI (your \u201clevers\u201d), and instantaneously shows you a detailed, optimized simulation of what changes your marketing strategy needs to grow. So instead of struggling through campaigns to find opportunities, you can work through opportunities to deliver results.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding the past is cool, but knowing the future is magic; with Levers, you get both. </p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 20], "assets/images/resized/0023/6728/236728v4-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 33], "assets/images/resized/0023/6728/236728v4-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 60], "assets/images/resized/0023/6728/236728v4-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Thu Oct 17 10:16:32 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "info@leve.rs", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Jonathan", "last_name": "Kressaty", "permalink": "jonathan-kressaty"}, "title": "CEO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Chuck", "last_name": "Reynolds", "permalink": "chuck-reynolds"}, "title": "Founding Partner"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Chris", "last_name": "Conrey", "permalink": "chris-conrey"}, "title": ""}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Andrew", "last_name": "Ryno", "permalink": "andrew-ryno"}, "title": "Founding Partner"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Scott", "last_name": "Yacko", "permalink": "scott-yacko"}, "title": "Founding Partner"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Emily L", "last_name": "Timm", "permalink": "emily-l-timm"}, "title": "Founding Partner"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Daniel", "last_name": "Valencia", "permalink": "daniel-valencia"}, "title": "Founding Member"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[150, 107], "assets/images/resized/0024/2507/242507v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 178], "assets/images/resized/0024/2507/242507v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 321], "assets/images/resized/0024/2507/242507v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, {"available_sizes": [[[149, 150], "assets/images/resized/0029/8165/298165v2-max-150x150.png"], [[249, 250], "assets/images/resized/0029/8165/298165v2-max-250x250.png"], [[448, 450], "assets/images/resized/0029/8165/298165v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "http://leve.rs/blog/feed/", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "San Francisco", "description": "Levers SF", "address1": "156 2nd St", "address2": "", "longitude": -122.3990501, "country_code": "USA", "latitude": 37.787249, "state_code": "CA", "zip_code": "94105"}], "phone_number": "", "description": "Predictive & Quantitative Marketing", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "levers", "milestones": [{"stoned_month": 6, "stoned_value": null, "stoneable_type": "Company", "description": "Levers launches its first product this week, Levers Feeds.
