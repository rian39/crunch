Critical results that need to be dealt with right away get buried in the pile, and doctors might get to them much later, or miss them altogether, a common problem resulting in hundreds of thousands of annual patient deaths. Our solution is a &#8220;priority inbox&#8221; for clinical reports. We take reports coming into the doctor&#8217;s office by fax or other means, digitize them (if necessary), and prioritize them using a proprietary process and algorithm. Doctors can then view these reports on a web or mobile interface and take immediate action.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 116], "assets/images/resized/0034/8773/348773v2-max-150x150.jpg"], [[250, 194], "assets/images/resized/0034/8773/348773v2-max-250x250.jpg"], [[300, 233], "assets/images/resized/0034/8773/348773v2-max-450x450.jpg"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Sun Oct 27 22:18:20 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "akansh@hermesclinical.com", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Dr.", "last_name": "Mark Singh", "permalink": "dr-mark-singh"}, "title": "Co-Founder"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Akansh", "last_name": "Murthy", "permalink": "akansh-murthy"}, "title": "Co-Founder"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Vishnu", "last_name": "Ravi", "permalink": "vishnu-ravi"}, "title": "Co-Founder"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [], "founded_day": 24, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Braintree", "description": "Boston Office", "address1": "340 Wood Rd", "address2": "#203", "longitude": null, "country_code": "USA", "latitude": null, "state_code": "MA", "zip_code": "02184"}], "phone_number": "", "description": "Streamlining clinical workflows", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "hermesclinical", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": 3, "founded_year": 2013, "founded_month": 9, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "hermes-clinical", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "Hermes Clinical", "created_at": "Sun Oct 27 20:46:00 UTC 2013", "homepage_url": "http://www.hermesclinical.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "http://hermesclinical.tumblr.com", "tag_list": "healthcare-it, productivity, saas, big-data, machine-learning", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
