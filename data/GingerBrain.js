It offers an intuitive way to work with open source R language. Even the analysts who are not familiar with R can use various statistical and predictive analytics techniques with GingerBrain point-and-click GUI. </p>\n\n<p>Analysts have choice to keep their GingerBrain-based analyses private or public.
