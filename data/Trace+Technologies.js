In addition, optic fibre reduces aircraft weight so improving fuel economy and increases the aircraft&#8217;s range.</p>\n\n<p>While both commercial and military aerospace manufacturers are keen to embrace the benefits of fibre optic cabling, the harsh working environment demands a high standard of system design. Designers need reliable tools to enable them to create harnesses that work first time, every time.</p>\n\n<p>Trace Technologies provides the solution with PISD\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 - the first dedicated practical engineering tool that means aerospace system engineers can easily design, install, test and build reliable fibre optic cable harnesses for next generation systems on today&#8217;s aircraft.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 91], "assets/images/resized/0008/5350/85350v1-max-150x150.jpg"], [[154, 94], "assets/images/resized/0008/5350/85350v1-max-250x250.jpg"], [[154, 94], "assets/images/resized/0008/5350/85350v1-max-450x450.jpg"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Thu Nov 07 05:58:27 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [{"investments": [{"person": null, "company": {"permalink": "xenos", "name": "Xenos"}, "financial_org": null}, {"person": null, "company": null, "financial_org": {"permalink": "hsbc-principal-investments", "name": "HSBC  Principal Investments"}}, {"person": null, "company": null, "financial_org": {"permalink": "welsh-assembly-government", "name": "Welsh Assembly Government"}}, {"person": null, "company": null, "financial_org": {"permalink": "finance-wales-investments", "name": "Finance Wales Investments"}}], "funded_month": 3, "source_description": "EDGAR", "round_code": "unattributed", "raised_amount": 1180000.0, "source_url": "", "raised_currency_code": "USD", "funded_year": 2007, "funded_day": 27, "id": 15003}, {"investments": [], "funded_month": 7, "source_description": "", "round_code": "seed", "raised_amount": 500000.0, "source_url": "", "raised_currency_code": "USD", "funded_year": 2012, "funded_day": 7, "id": 54015}], "total_money_raised": "$1.68M", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "", "alias_list": "", "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "J.", "last_name": "Diego De La Cruz", "permalink": "j-diego-de-la-cruz"}, "title": "co-founder"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[150, 118], "assets/images/resized/0008/5351/85351v1-max-150x150.jpg"], [[250, 198], "assets/images/resized/0008/5351/85351v1-max-250x250.jpg"], [[450, 356], "assets/images/resized/0008/5351/85351v1-max-450x450.jpg"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "", "description": "HQ", "address1": "", "address2": "", "longitude": null, "country_code": "GBR", "latitude": null, "state_code": null, "zip_code": ""}], "phone_number": "", "description": "aerospace system ", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": null, "founded_year": 2002, "founded_month": null, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "trace-technologies", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "Trace Technologies", "created_at": "Thu Apr 29 17:39:23 UTC 2010", "homepage_url": "http://www.tracetechnologies.co.uk", "products": [], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "big-data, gamification, internet-things", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
