SNTMNT is developing online sentiment analysis and prediction tools that make financial sentiment in word-of-mouth surrounding stocks tangible. This way it helps investors make better investment decisions. </p>\n\n<p>SNTMNT is offering three products: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Trading Indicator API\nMultiple studies over the past years have shown that Twitter sentiment can be used as an indicator for future stock price movement. The trading indicator gives hourly and/or daily buy &amp; sell signals for all S&amp;P 500 stocks based on online sentiment on Twitter. The stock price predictions are based upon various machine learning algorithms and have an accuracy as high as 60 percent with an average of 54 percent. The predictions take away extra noise in asset pricing, and can be used by investors as an additional trading indicator on top of fundamental analysis and technical analysis.</p></li>\n<li><p>Financial Sentiment API\nSentiment is hard to classify in financially themed Twitter messages, mainly because financial markets speak their own language of fear and greed. The Financial Sentiment API is specifically trained to deal with unstructured context and financial jargon, and has an accuracy of 84.3% on a binary scale and an accuracy of 76.8% on a three point scale. </p></li>\n<li><p>Brand Sentiment API\nClassify sentiment in social media messages surrounding brands. The algorithm is specifically tailored to brands, products &amp; company information. It has an accuracy of 84.7% on a binary scale and an accuracy of 86.9% on a three point scale. </p></li>\n</ul>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 28], "assets/images/resized/0019/8815/198815v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 47], "assets/images/resized/0019/8815/198815v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 85], "assets/images/resized/0019/8815/198815v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Wed Jul 24 10:38:52 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [{"investments": [{"person": {"first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Aelen", "permalink": "paul-aelen"}, "company": null, "financial_org": null}], "funded_month": 3, "source_description": "", "round_code": "seed", "raised_amount": 50000.0, "source_url": "", "raised_currency_code": "USD", "funded_year": 2012, "funded_day": 23, "id": 31094}], "total_money_raised": "$50k", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "info@sntmnt.com", "alias_list": "", "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Wouter", "last_name": "Kneepkens", "permalink": "wouter-kneepkens"}, "title": "Co-Founder"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Vincent", "last_name": "van Leeuwen", "permalink": "vincent-van-leeuwen"}, "title": "Co-Founder"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Tim", "last_name": "Harbers", "permalink": "tim-harbers"}, "title": "Co-Founder"}], "partners": [{"link_2_url": null, "partner_name": "AngelList", "link_1_url": "https://angel.co/sntmnt?utm_source=crunchbase&utm_medium=link&utm_content=profile&utm_term=sntmnt&utm_campaign=crunchbase", "link_3_url": null, "link_3_name": null, "homepage_url": "http://www.SNTMNT.com", "link_1_name": "AngelList Page", "link_2_name": null}], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[150, 90], "assets/images/resized/0027/5574/275574v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 151], "assets/images/resized/0027/5574/275574v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 271], "assets/images/resized/0027/5574/275574v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": 30, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Amsterdam", "description": "World HQ", "address1": "", "address2": "", "longitude": null, "country_code": "NLD", "latitude": null, "state_code": null, "zip_code": ""}], "phone_number": "", "description": "Sentiment analysis for financial markets", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "sntmnt", "milestones": [{"stoned_month": 3, "stoned_value": null, "stoneable_type": "Company", "description": "SNTMNT launches retail brokerage dashboard with Binck Bank", "stoned_acquirer": null, "source_description": "Social sentiment gets another shot in the investment world as SNTMNT opens up to BinckBank customers", "stoneable": {"permalink": "sntmnt", "name": "SNTMNT"}, "source_url": "http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/03/18/social-sentiment-takes-another-step-forward-in-the-investment-world-as-sntmnt-opens-up-to-500k-binckbank-customers/", "stoned_day": 18, "stoned_value_type": null, "source_text": null, "stoned_year": 2013, "id": 36398}], "external_links": [{"title": "", "external_url": "http://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/07/05/twitter-sentiment-and-the-stock-market-sntmnts-api-helps-traders-pick-the-best-time-to-buy-or-sell/"}, {"title": "The Financial Times", "external_url": "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/af9ed4f6-19e8-11e2-a179-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2AE4mRE00"}], "number_of_employees": 10, "founded_year": 2011, "founded_month": 11, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "sntmnt", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "SNTMNT", "created_at": "Wed Jul 04 14:03:36 UTC 2012", "homepage_url": "http://www.SNTMNT.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "http://blog.sntmnt.com", "tag_list": "sentiment, analysis, twitter, sp500, nlp, text-analytics", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
