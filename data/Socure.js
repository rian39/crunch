Socure&#8217;s Social Biometrics(TM) solution adds a novel social twist to realtime identity verification and fraud detection to defend enterprises against identity fraud.</p>\n\n<p>The rise of social media and efforts to monetize consumer data through marketing and advertising has resulted in the easy availability of our personal information such as mother&#8217;s maiden name, favorite pet&#8217;s name, place of birth etc. on the Internet today. It&#8217;s no surprise then that identity fraud is now growing faster than world trade in some countries. In the US alone, $48 Billion was lost by financial institutions to identity fraud last year. In fact most tier-1 financial institutions are losing an average of over $100 Million per year per institution despite the fraud detection technologies implemented over the last decade. There are impacts to society beyond financial loss as a result of identity fraud. The problem is global.</p>\n\n<p>Socure Social Biometrics(TM) uses the power of social attestation &#8211; the process that goes on when we interact with our family, friends, peers and followers in unique ways &#8211; as a way to improve identity verification and identity fraud detection in realtime. Socure&#8217;s team of machine learning experts have created powerful patent pending algorithms and linked data processing techniques to extract this social attestation signal in realtime. This additive signal to existing fraud detection solutions reduces fraud losses, false positives and negatives as well as fraud-mitigation call center overhead; all of which impact an enterprise&#8217;s top and bottom line. Unlike other types of biometric solutions, Social Biometrics(TM) does not require any training or change of behavior on the consumer&#8217;s part. An enterprise can be social or traditional and still derive the benefits of our proven solution. </p>\n\n<p>Identity proofing drives everything in credit and commerce today and forms the under-pinnings of social-commerce around the world tomorrow.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 150], "assets/images/resized/0015/3832/153832v15-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 250], "assets/images/resized/0015/3832/153832v15-max-250x250.png"], [[324, 324], "assets/images/resized/0015/3832/153832v15-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Sat Oct 19 02:58:18 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [{"investments": [], "funded_month": 9, "source_description": "", "round_code": "seed", "raised_amount": 1700000.0, "source_url": "", "raised_currency_code": "USD", "funded_year": 2013, "funded_day": 13, "id": 40396}, {"investments": [], "funded_month": 9, "source_description": "SEC", "round_code": "debt_round", "raised_amount": 600000.0, "source_url": "http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1566310/000089843213001251/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml", "raised_currency_code": "USD", "funded_year": 2013, "funded_day": 23, "id": 50014}], "total_money_raised": "$2.3M", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "info@socure.com", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Dr.", "last_name": "Sam Leinhardt", "permalink": "dr-sam-leinhardt"}, "title": "Chairman"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Sunil", "last_name": "Madhu", "permalink": "sunil-madhu"}, "title": "Co-Founder & CEO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Johnny", "last_name": "Ayers", "permalink": "johnny-ayers"}, "title": "Co-Founder & Director of Business Development"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Oscar", "last_name": "Salazar", "permalink": "oscar-salazar"}, "title": "Director"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Philip", "last_name": "Eytan", "permalink": "philip-eytan"}, "title": "Director & founding Investor"}, {"is_past": true, "person": {"first_name": "Bradley", "last_name": "S.
