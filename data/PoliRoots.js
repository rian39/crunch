We offer everything you need to grow your political campaign, whether you are a low-budgeted state candidate or a Political Action Committee. Our platform is a campaign organizational tool that incorporates phone banking, social media integration, and data mining/analysis. PoliRoots is the first interactive service to have infrastructure that incorporates social networking for volunteers, big data analysis, and an online GOTV package for political campaigns.</p>\n\n<p>Why it&#8217;s necessary?</p>\n\n<p>We want to help better manage smaller, lower budget candidate and organization campaigns because there is not balancing level playing field.</p>\n\n<p>What is wrong with current phone banking? </p>\n\n<p>Current phone banking for campaigns that don\u2019t have the resources of their own  to track their data. Most organizations still use paper call sheets that someone at the end of the day would input data into a system. PoliRoots will make it effortless.  </p>\n\n<p>What Do We Provide? \n\u2022Paperless GO GREEN!\n\u2022Social Media Integration\n\u2022Data-Mining and Machine Learning\n\u2022Web program to make calls from computer\n\u2022Automatic data input \n\u2022Phone numbers by state/city<br/>\n\u2022Mass emailing service / Newsletters \n\u2022Conference calls\n\u2022Step by step phone banking script </p>\n\n<p>Website Details: \n\u2022User-friendly profiles \n\u2022Pop-up Chat \n\u2022Training videos \n\u2022Organizational Groups \n\u2022Event Invites\n\u2022Campaign Calendars \n\u2022Interaction (Campaign Photos and Updates) \n\u2022Goal Objectives (Election Countdowns)\n\u2022Widgets \n\u2022Street Canvassing App</p>\n\n<p>Target Market:<br/>\n\u2022Political Organizations \n\u2022Candidates \n\u2022Interest Groups \n\u2022527\u2019s \n\u2022Political Action Committees \n\u2022Think tanks\n\u2022Fundraising Campaigns</p>\n\n<p>How long will it take?\nWe are currently working on the prototype.

There is an election every year, the two biggest being a presidential election year and a midterm year. Campaigns are looking for new, easier ways to make their campaigns more efficient. President Obama&#8217;s tech team used data-mining and predictive analytics as a way to reach out to more voters. PoliRoots will provide the same resources.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 150], "assets/images/resized/0021/9949/219949v4-max-150x150.jpg"], [[250, 250], "assets/images/resized/0021/9949/219949v4-max-250x250.jpg"], [[300, 300], "assets/images/resized/0021/9949/219949v4-max-450x450.jpg"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Mon Mar 04 19:58:58 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "ldrogers8@gmail.com", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Adam", "last_name": "Buran", "permalink": "adam-buran"}, "title": "Founder"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [{"competitor": {"permalink": "blast-roots", "name": "Blast Roots"}}, {"competitor": {"permalink": "blastroots-inc", "name": "BlastRoots"}}, {"competitor": {"permalink": "hootsuite", "name": "HootSuite"}}], "blog_feed_url": "http://blog.poliroots.com/feed", "providerships": [], "offices": [], "phone_number": "2409942051", "description": "A web service for political campaigns", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "PoliRootsLLC", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": 4, "founded_year": 2012, "founded_month": 10, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "poliroots", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "PoliRoots", "created_at": "Tue Oct 16 03:37:08 UTC 2012", "homepage_url": "http://poliroots.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "http://blog.poliroots.com", "tag_list": "", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
