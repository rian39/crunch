And right now companies are using Big Data analytics to illuminate parts of their business where previously they had had little or no insight. Big Data attributes can account for human relationships and personal preferences \u2013 they can describe products, predict consumer choices, show you who people are, where they go and what they do, what they like and don&#8217;t like.</p>\n\n<p>The skill is in making sense of that data, and doing so enables you to solve business problems that, in the past, just couldn&#8217;t be solved. Big Data data can be aggregated and mined through Hadoop, NoSQL (Not only Structured Query Language), graph database, or other big-data platforms which search for patterns. It means it&#8217;s now perfectly possible to analyse entire data sets rather than just subsets; it means analysing much more detailed data \u2013 and this increase in the data you have at your disposal can be a massive business advantage.</p>\n\n<p>Big Data applications are increasingly deployed in business processes \u2013 such as customer experience optimization, multichannel conversation management, and behaviorally targeted offers \u2013 that are dynamic, contextual and situational in nature. Big Data Analysis allows you to access your data in near-real time and make decisions and adjust business plans accordingly. Instead of basing your decisions on the past - on your historical data \u2013 you can now base them on the present.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want your business to be left behind, if you want to compete \u2013 now and in the future \u2013 you need to use this vast stream of data to your advantage. That&#8217;s where we come in: we have experts who understand the situation, understand business and value creation, and can build the technical setup that delivers your ideal Big Data business solution.</p>\n\n<p>We offer you the opportunity to gain a competitive advantage, allowing you to react more quickly and base your business strategy decisions on information you never had before \u2013 we enable you, for the first time, to use Big Data to make the kind of strategic business decisions that can transform your business.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 40], "assets/images/resized/0035/0101/350101v2-max-150x150.png"], [[228, 61], "assets/images/resized/0035/0101/350101v2-max-250x250.png"], [[228, 61], "assets/images/resized/0035/0101/350101v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Wed Oct 30 10:10:41 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "contact@xtendsys.net", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": true, "person": {"first_name": "BENSACI", "last_name": "Karim", "permalink": "bensaci-karim"}, "title": "CEO"}, {"is_past": true, "person": {"first_name": "CAMBOLIN", "last_name": "Nicolas", "permalink": "cambolin-nicolas"}, "title": "CMO & Biz Dev"}, {"is_past": true, "person": {"first_name": "Arnaud", "last_name": "GAILLARD", "permalink": "cto-founder-2"}, "title": "CTO"}, {"is_past": true, "person": {"first_name": "Thomas", "last_name": "FOREAU", "permalink": "coo-founder"}, "title": "COO"}, {"is_past": true, "person": {"first_name": "GM", "last_name": "FR", "permalink": "gm-fr"}, "title": "GM FR"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Yverdon Les Bains", "description": "Headquarters", "address1": "Galilee 6", "address2": "", "longitude": null, "country_code": "CHE", "latitude": null, "state_code": null, "zip_code": "1400"}, {"city": "Issy Les moulineaux", "description": "Xtendsys France", "address1": "Av de Verdun 198", "address2": "", "longitude": null, "country_code": "FRA", "latitude": null, "state_code": null, "zip_code": "92130"}], "phone_number": "", "description": "business and data intelligence", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": 20, "founded_year": 2012, "founded_month": 7, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "xtendsys", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "XTENDSYS", "created_at": "Tue Oct 29 17:03:43 UTC 2013", "homepage_url": "https://www.xtendsys.net/", "products": [], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "big-data, business-intelligence, cloud, europe, switzerland, france", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
