{"category_code": "software", "crunchbase_url": "http://www.crunchbase.com/company/lifeassist", "video_embeds": [], "deadpooled_month": null, "overview": "<p>A leading innovator in the North American Life Insurance industry, delivering high impact technology solutions that address the prominent issues of high agent turnover and in-force policy data mining.</p>\n\n<p>The company&#8217;s flagship product, lifeAssist\u2122, is the ultimate solution for managing and monetizing in-force life insurance policies, preparing comprehensive sales packages for prospective clients, and distributing sales leads to veteran and early-stage producers</p>\n\n<p>With lifeAssist\u2122, producers store all of their policy data in one secure location, allowing the system to continuously analyze each policy and determine whether or not it is sustainable and whether there is a better alternative. Whenever an opportunity is identified, which occurs with about 25% of in-force policies, a client-ready report is generated, illustrating the short and long term cost implications of the client\u2019s current plan versus alternatives and using proprietary logic to explain a set of recommendations. This gives producers the opportunity to catch policies before they lapse, and generate a sale, without requiring a heavy commitment of their time. </p>\n\n<p>With a shrinking and aging broker force, fewer agents are available to service policies, and the pool of \u2018orphan\u2019 policyholders has risen dramatically. In addition, insurance professionals need to be made aware of the problems within their inforce book of business and need to know how to order and analyze in-force data and make appropriate recommendations. Since doing so is extremely profitable, lifeAssist\u2122 exists.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 48], "assets/images/resized/0019/9104/199104v6-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 80], "assets/images/resized/0019/9104/199104v6-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 144], "assets/images/resized/0019/9104/199104v6-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Sun Oct 06 22:26:07 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [{"investments": [], "funded_month": 9, "source_description": "", "round_code": "seed", "raised_amount": 50000.0, "source_url": "", "raised_currency_code": "CAD", "funded_year": 2010, "funded_day": 1, "id": 31107}, {"investments": [], "funded_month": 7, "source_description": "", "round_code": "a", "raised_amount": 250000.0, "source_url": "", "raised_currency_code": "CAD", "funded_year": 2012, "funded_day": 1, "id": 31108}, {"investments": [], "funded_month": 10, "source_description": "", "round_code": "a", "raised_amount": 560000.0, "source_url": "", "raised_currency_code": "USD", "funded_year": 2013, "funded_day": 5, "id": 50955}], "total_money_raised": "C$860k", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "cam@lifeassist.ca", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Karan", "last_name": "Kanodia", "permalink": "karan-kanodia"}, "title": "Co-Founder, COO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Cameron", "last_name": "Jacox", "permalink": "cameron-jacox"}, "title": "Co-Founder, CPO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "James", "last_name": "E.C.
