It supplies recommendation portfolios across 40 market segments (3000 stocks) with historic returns over 20%.  Only liquid, US exchanged traded stocks and ETFs are considered.\nEach night the ZZAlpha machine learning technique processes over half a billion pieces of market data to learn the current dynamics of the market, and to place those in historical context.\nHistoric returns have statistical confidence exceeding 3 sigma (ETFs) and 8 sigma (stocks), calculated from large Monte Carlo simulations.\nThe ZZAlpha work proves the efficient market hypothesis is false, and that market timing can be effective.\nSubscribers are professional investors.  </p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 36], "assets/images/resized/0015/4535/154535v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 60], "assets/images/resized/0015/4535/154535v2-max-250x250.png"], [[279, 68], "assets/images/resized/0015/4535/154535v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Sun Nov 13 23:18:10 UTC 2011", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "info@zzalpha.com", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": true, "person": {"first_name": "Kevin", "last_name": "Pratt", "permalink": "kevin-pratt"}, "title": "Founder and Chief Scientist"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [], "founded_day": 1, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Tucson", "description": "Mail address", "address1": "4729 E Sunrise #109", "address2": "", "longitude": null, "country_code": "USA", "latitude": null, "state_code": "AZ", "zip_code": "85718"}], "phone_number": "866-630-7025", "description": "Machine learning stock recommendations", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": 2, "founded_year": 2010, "founded_month": 7, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "zzalpha", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "ZZAlpha", "created_at": "Fri Sep 16 19:03:33 UTC 2011", "homepage_url": "http://www.zzalpha.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "machine-learning, stock-recommendation, etf-recommendation, market-timing, stock-analysis", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
