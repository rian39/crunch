With nearly 100 members, just about every Internet ad served in the US involves the technology of one or more NAI companies. These third-party services are crucial for a diverse Internet ecosystem and digital economy as they help to facilitate the dynamic, free, ad-supported Internet that consumers love and expect. But privacy and consumer trust are also crucial. The NAI&#8217;s role, therefore, is to ensure the health of the online ecosystem by maintaining and enforcing high standards for data collection and use in online advertising. With buy-in and support from our member companies, the NAI sets the bar for online privacy through a body of self-regulatory policies \u2013 the NAI Code \u2013 and through a robust compliance enforcement program that helps members live up to our high standards, but holds them accountable when they don&#8217;t. </p>\n\n<p>Learn more about us at http://www.networkadvertising.org/about-nai/about-nai</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 64], "assets/images/resized/0035/9448/359448v2-max-150x150.png"], [[161, 69], "assets/images/resized/0035/9448/359448v2-max-250x250.png"], [[161, 69], "assets/images/resized/0035/9448/359448v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Fri Nov 15 02:06:58 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Rob", "last_name": "Gratchner", "permalink": "rob-gratchner"}, "title": "Chairman of the Board"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Bill", "last_name": "Grossman", "permalink": "bill-grossman"}, "title": "Board Member"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[150, 92], "assets/images/resized/0035/9449/359449v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 154], "assets/images/resized/0035/9449/359449v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 277], "assets/images/resized/0035/9449/359449v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Washington", "description": "Headquarter", "address1": "1634 Eye St. NW Suite 750", "address2": "", "longitude": null, "country_code": "USA", "latitude": null, "state_code": "DC", "zip_code": "20006"}], "phone_number": "", "description": "", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "", "milestones": [], "external_links": [{"title": "Advertisters scared as internet giants look to cut cookies out of their diets", "external_url": "http://www.marketplace.org/topics/tech/advertisters-scared-internet-giants-look-cut-cookies-out-their-diets"}, {"title": "Tech sticks to script on new leak \u2014 Leahy points to FISA court reform \u2014 The latest on Sandberg watch", "external_url": "http://www.politico.com/morningtech/1013/morningtech11936.html"}, {"title": "Privacy advocates, online ad groups still doubt Do Not Track talks", "external_url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/188838-privacy-advocates-online-ad-groups-still-doubt-do-not-track-talks"}, {"title": "Do Not Track W3C murder plot fails by handful of votes", "external_url": "http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/10/28/do_not_track_w3c_split/"}, {"title": "Do you find online ads and apps creepy?", "external_url": "http://mv-voice.com/blogs/p/2013/10/21/do-you-find-online-ads-and-apps-creepy"}], "number_of_employees": null, "founded_year": 2000, "founded_month": null, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "network-advertising-intiative", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "Network Advertising Intiative", "created_at": "Thu May 09 20:25:39 UTC 2013", "homepage_url": "", "products": [], "blog_url": "http://www.networkadvertising.org/blog", "tag_list": "interest-based-advertising, self-regulation, marketing, advertising, big-data", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
