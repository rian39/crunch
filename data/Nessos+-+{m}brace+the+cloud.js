It is taking care of all things that have to do with task orchestration and data flow between computer nodes, allowing the user to deal just with the algorithm that he wants to execute. Moreover, it abstracts the underlying cloud infrastructure which means that any code developed using {m}brace can either run on a private or a public cloud that is supported.</p>\n\n<p>{m}brace is also providing the mbrace shell where someone can delve into REPL style programming which enables fast code prototyping in a cloud scale. Moreover it enables you to monitor your computer nodes, deploy new code and get information about the jobs that are currently executing.</p>\n\n<p>{m}brace also offers superior performance compared to the competition, providing upto 2x faster running times compared with Hadoop in various big data benchmarking algorithms.</p>\n\n<p>Use {m}brace to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Harness the computational power of contemporary compute farms </li>\n<li>Boost productivity by giving the developer a simple, streamlined programming experience</li>\n<li>Facilitate the utilization of legacy code to distributed parallel environments</li>\n<li>Gain maximum performance from your computer nodes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>{m}brace is the flagship of Nessos, a highly qualified software development company, based mostly on Microsoft .NET with C# and F# as languages of choice. Nessos excels in custom integrated solutions with advanced software engineering requirements and has developed applications in a variety of business sectors.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 48], "assets/images/resized/0029/6259/296259v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 81], "assets/images/resized/0029/6259/296259v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 145], "assets/images/resized/0029/6259/296259v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Wed Oct 02 23:15:01 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "ppetrogian@nessos.gr", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": true, "person": {"first_name": "Kostas", "last_name": "Rammos", "permalink": "kostas-rammos"}, "title": "CEO"}, {"is_past": true, "person": {"first_name": "Pantelis", "last_name": "Petrogiannakis", "permalink": "pantelis-petrogiannakis"}, "title": "Technical Director"}, {"is_past": true, "person": {"first_name": "Apostolos", "last_name": "Zafiris", "permalink": "apostolos-zafiris"}, "title": "President"}, {"is_past": true, "person": {"first_name": "George", "last_name": "Stavroulakis", "permalink": "george-stavroulakis"}, "title": "{m}bracethecloud Product manager"}, {"is_past": true, "person": {"first_name": "Nick", "last_name": "Palladinos", "permalink": "nick-palladinos"}, "title": "{m}bracethecloud lead engineer"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [], "founded_day": 13, "competitions": [{"competitor": {"permalink": "hadoop", "name": "Hadoop"}}, {"competitor": {"permalink": "typesafe", "name": "Typesafe"}}, {"competitor": {"permalink": "gridgain-systems", "name": "GridGain Systems"}}], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Athens", "description": "Headquarters", "address1": "89 patision avenue", "address2": "", "longitude": null, "country_code": "GRC", "latitude": null, "state_code": null, "zip_code": "10434"}], "phone_number": "+30 2108847000", "description": "A big data framework for the cloud", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "mbracethecloud", "milestones": [{"stoned_month": 5, "stoned_value": null, "stoneable_type": "Company", "description": "{m}brace the cloud alpha version  is available to registered users", "stoned_acquirer": null, "source_description": "Alpha version", "stoneable": {"permalink": "nessos-m-brace-the-cloud", "name": "Nessos - {m}brace the cloud"}, "source_url": "http://www.m-brace.net/alpha-testing/", "stoned_day": 30, "stoned_value_type": null, "source_text": null, "stoned_year": 2013, "id": 37212}, {"stoned_month": 8, "stoned_value": null, "stoneable_type": "Company", "description": "{m}brace version 0.4.3 has been released!", "stoned_acquirer": null, "source_description": "{m}brace version 0.4.3 has been released!", "stoneable": {"permalink": "nessos-m-brace-the-cloud", "name": "Nessos - {m}brace the cloud"}, "source_url": "http://www.m-brace.net/blog/", "stoned_day": 13, "stoned_value_type": null, "source_text": null, "stoned_year": 2013, "id": 39043}, {"stoned_month": 8, "stoned_value": null, "stoneable_type": "Company", "description": "We are pleased to announce that our paper, \u201cMBrace: Cloud Computing with Monads\u201d, has been accepted for presentation at the Programming Languages and Operating Systems workshop, co-located with the SOSP 2013 conference.
