Users can interact both with the website content and their social network friends onsite and use the drag-and-drop function to share items, make recommendations, make purchases, collect photos etc.\nThe eblizz services include a social analytics platform designed to collect contextual data that is specific to a website&#8217;s audience, content and activities.  The analytics give companies a detailed snapshot of the user, how and where the content was spread, where purchases are made, and number of downloads.   This enables a company to effectively incorporate this data-mining into their WOM marketing strategy.\nThe focus of eblizz is to help companies with an online presence optimize the marketing power of the Social Web. </p>\n\n<p>Product Differentiation</p>\n\n<p>How do we differ from all the share buttons out there? The focus of share buttons is to grab a piece of content and push it to the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stream, in essence attempting to syndicate that to as many users as possible. Use of share buttons started to gain momentum in 2009. What we see now, however, is that the user&#8217;s news feeds are spammed with content that becomes less and less relevant. eblizz has a different approach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c allowing brand sites and social networks to work together in a way that enables the social networks to become a part of each brand&#8217;s site and vice versa. \neblizz also makes it possible for users to share content in a fun way AND directly interact with their social network while on the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s web site \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is the key. They can, for example, read their news stream and drop a product from the site directly into the news stream or post comments. The idea is to keep them on a website as long as possible and to allow them to interact with the site&#8217;s content in an exciting way. \nAdditionally users can store the products they find in what is called the Shoebox. In the Shoebox they have a variety of options to manipulate the stored content and share from within the Shoebox.</p>\n\n<p>Revenue Model</p>\n\n<p>eblizz will generate revenue through a fixed-price models with monthly fees. Alternative pricing models such as commission-based revenue generation will be explored.</p>\n\n<p>Phase II \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Build-Out of Application\nThe Drag-and-Drop link below provides a video demonstration of the application that is in beta testing today.  eblizz seeks $500,000 for Second Stage financing to build out the application - here is a sneak peak of what is coming next:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Making the core products stronger.  This will include the ability for live chat on a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website, meaning that users can directly chat with their facebook friends on the web site discussing the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Extend the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products to facebook itself, so products are showcased on facebook as part of a facebook application. Each user will, through his/her actions, automatically create a mini-shop that shows his/her favorite products.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[113, 27], "assets/images/resized/0004/6173/46173v2-max-150x150.png"], [[113, 27], "assets/images/resized/0004/6173/46173v2-max-250x250.png"], [[113, 27], "assets/images/resized/0004/6173/46173v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Wed Oct 16 07:13:27 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [{"investments": [{"person": {"first_name": "Roman", "last_name": "Scharf", "permalink": "roman-scharf"}, "company": null, "financial_org": null}], "funded_month": 1, "source_description": "", "round_code": "angel", "raised_amount": 650000.0, "source_url": "", "raised_currency_code": "USD", "funded_year": 2008, "funded_day": 1, "id": 6261}], "total_money_raised": "$650k", "deadpooled_day": 8, "email_address": "info@eblizz.com", "alias_list": "", "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Jeanette", "last_name": "Okwu", "permalink": "jeanette-okwu"}, "title": "Founder/President"}, {"is_past": true, "person": {"first_name": "Martin", "last_name": "Wawrusch", "permalink": "martin-wawrusch"}, "title": "Founder/CEO"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [{"is_past": false, "provider": {"permalink": "alliance-counsel-llp", "name": "Alliance Counsel LLP"}, "title": ""}], "offices": [{"city": "Los Angeles", "description": "eblizz, Inc.", "address1": "", "address2": "", "longitude": -118.4920896, "country_code": "USA", "latitude": 34.0163012, "state_code": "CA", "zip_code": ""}], "phone_number": "", "description": "Social Content Aggregator", "deadpooled_year": 2011, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "", "milestones": [], "external_links": [{"title": "", "external_url": "http://www.piabo.net/en/principal.html"}, {"title": "eblizz - the next shopping extension", "external_url": "http://www.thestrategyweb.com/eblizz-the-next-social-shopping-extension"}], "number_of_employees": 8, "founded_year": null, "founded_month": null, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "eblizz", "deadpooled_url": "", "name": "eblizz", "created_at": "Mon Jun 01 18:00:00 UTC 2009", "homepage_url": "http://eblizz.com", "products": [{"permalink": "social-space", "name": "Social Space"}], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "aggregator, social-networks, social-networking, online-content, multimedia, social-content-distribution, e-commerce, digital, social-media-marketing, social-shopping, viral-content, content-distribution", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
