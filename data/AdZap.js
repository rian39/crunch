The Adzap browser add-on recognizes all of the ads on a page and lets you quickly Zap the ones you don&#8217;t like by putting a clickable Ray Gun in the corner of the ad. Once you Zap an ad, you&#8217;ll never see it again anywhere else on the web. Plus, you&#8217;ll be rewarded with XP that you can use to Level Up and unlock special items. Launched in April 2012, Adzap is currently compatible with the Chrome browser and can be downloaded for free at www.getadzap.com.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 34], "assets/images/resized/0018/4445/184445v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 57], "assets/images/resized/0018/4445/184445v2-max-250x250.png"], [[300, 69], "assets/images/resized/0018/4445/184445v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Thu Apr 19 01:48:06 UTC 2012", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "contact@getadzap.com", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [], "partners": [], "screenshots": [], "founded_day": 1, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [], "phone_number": "3106516351", "description": "Zap Annoying Internet Ads Forever", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "getadzap", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": 2, "founded_year": 2012, "founded_month": 3, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "adzap", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "AdZap", "created_at": "Mon Apr 16 17:42:46 UTC 2012", "homepage_url": "http://www.getadzap.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "advertising, big-data", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
