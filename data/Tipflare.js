After users tell Tipflare examples of what they like, Tipflare immediately tells them examples (or tips) of what it thinks they&#8217;ll love. Tipflare tries to understand its users&#8217; tastes so its tips are personalized for each user. To reflect this, every tip a user receives comes with a score that indicates how much Tipflare thinks the tip is a match for the user.</p>\n\n<p>Tipflare also includes a &#8220;New for You&#8221; option, which gives users tips based on where they are, the day of the week, the time of day, and more. For example, at dinner time it suggests a restaurant close to the user. Similarly, on a weeknight it suggests a TV show.</p>\n\n<p>Users can connect their Facebook account to Tipflare so Tipflare can consider their friends&#8217; interests when creating tips. Users can also see which of their friends liked different tips, share their tips, and contact their friends to ask about tips.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 43], "assets/images/resized/0019/9241/199241v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 72], "assets/images/resized/0019/9241/199241v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 131], "assets/images/resized/0019/9241/199241v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Fri Jul 06 19:35:02 UTC 2012", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "contact@tipflare.com", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Hayden", "last_name": "Metsky", "permalink": "hayden-metsky"}, "title": "Founder"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Thiago", "last_name": "Vieira", "permalink": "thiago-vieira"}, "title": "Co-Founder"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[150, 109], "assets/images/resized/0019/9239/199239v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 182], "assets/images/resized/0019/9239/199239v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 328], "assets/images/resized/0019/9239/199239v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, {"available_sizes": [[[146, 150], "assets/images/resized/0019/9240/199240v2-max-150x150.png"], [[243, 250], "assets/images/resized/0019/9240/199240v2-max-250x250.png"], [[438, 450], "assets/images/resized/0019/9240/199240v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [], "phone_number": "", "description": "Discover what you'll love.", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": null, "founded_year": 2012, "founded_month": 6, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "tipflare", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "Tipflare", "created_at": "Fri Jul 06 14:29:42 UTC 2012", "homepage_url": "http://www.tipflare.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "discovery, recommendations, movies, music, restaurants, machine-learning, artificial-intelligence", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
