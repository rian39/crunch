This explosion of pixel data is creating the need for fast, hyper-accurate, and automatic tagging of massive collections of images.</p>\n\n<p>The Solution.</p>\n\n<p>TaggPic technology is based solely on visual features, and does not require any metadata, such as GPS tags, manual tagging, or other location sensors, although it is capable of working with inputs from all three. The underlying algorithms can determine the precise position of the camera viewpoint in a geo-referenced coordinate system, even if no prior data about the photo\u2019s location is known.</p>\n\n<p>TaggPic transforms static 2D photos into auto-tagged, geo-positioned, and intelligently connected platforms. TaggPic\u2019s crowd-fueled computer vision technology instantly recognizes landmarks, buildings, and other objects in images without the need for GPS data or manual tagging.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 38], "assets/images/resized/0033/0264/330264v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 64], "assets/images/resized/0033/0264/330264v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 116], "assets/images/resized/0033/0264/330264v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Tue Sep 24 20:28:40 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Beth", "last_name": "Xie", "permalink": "beth-xie"}, "title": "CEO and Co-founder"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Andrew", "last_name": "Gallagher", "permalink": "andrew-gallagher-3"}, "title": "CTO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Noah", "last_name": "Snavely", "permalink": "noah-snavely"}, "title": "Co-founder and Chief Scientist"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Chuck", "last_name": "Yang", "permalink": "chuck-yang"}, "title": "Chief Engineer"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[150, 87], "assets/images/resized/0033/0263/330263v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 145], "assets/images/resized/0033/0263/330263v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 262], "assets/images/resized/0033/0263/330263v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Ithaca", "description": "Ithaca, NY", "address1": "", "address2": "", "longitude": null, "country_code": "USA", "latitude": null, "state_code": "NY", "zip_code": "14850"}], "phone_number": "", "description": "Intelligent Photo Tagging", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": 4, "founded_year": 2012, "founded_month": null, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "taggpic", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "TaggPic", "created_at": "Fri Sep 20 16:38:44 UTC 2013", "homepage_url": "http://www.taggpic.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "location-recognition, big-data, geo-recognition, computer-vision, travel, tourism, landmarks, tagging, location", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
