BlockAvenue is the app for your neighborhood.</p>\n\n<p>Most of your neighborhood is already online.  Some of it is on Yelp and Foursquare while other components are on Twitter, Facebook, Eventbrite and Groupon. BlockAvenue aggregates all of these sources, plus dozens more, and packages them up into a single mobile feed to help you stay connected to everything that is happening in your neighborhood.</p>\n\n<p>Our app is very simple.  On BlockAvenue, you follow the neighborhoods that you care about most.  Be it a small three block area around your Soho apartment or one-mile radius around your favorite vacation spot, all you have to do is draw the location on our map and we do the rest. </p>\n\n<p>We are a seed funded startup based out of the PayPal Start Tank in downtown Boston.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 150], "assets/images/resized/0020/5542/205542v1-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 250], "assets/images/resized/0020/5542/205542v1-max-250x250.png"], [[250, 250], "assets/images/resized/0020/5542/205542v1-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Fri Nov 29 09:58:59 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [{"investments": [], "funded_month": 6, "source_description": "", "round_code": "seed", "raised_amount": 1000000.0, "source_url": "", "raised_currency_code": "USD", "funded_year": 2013, "funded_day": 12, "id": 31853}], "total_money_raised": "$1M", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "info@blockavenue.com", "alias_list": "", "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Anthony", "last_name": "Longo", "permalink": "anthony-longo"}, "title": "Founder"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Melki", "last_name": "Ko", "permalink": "melki-ko"}, "title": "Director of Business Development"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[150, 88], "assets/images/resized/0021/5772/215772v2-max-150x150.jpg"], [[250, 148], "assets/images/resized/0021/5772/215772v2-max-250x250.jpg"], [[450, 266], "assets/images/resized/0021/5772/215772v2-max-450x450.jpg"]], "attribution": null}, {"available_sizes": [[[150, 85], "assets/images/resized/0025/5267/255267v2-max-150x150.jpg"], [[250, 142], "assets/images/resized/0025/5267/255267v2-max-250x250.jpg"], [[450, 255], "assets/images/resized/0025/5267/255267v2-max-450x450.jpg"]], "attribution": null}, {"available_sizes": [[[150, 85], "assets/images/resized/0025/5268/255268v2-max-150x150.jpg"], [[250, 142], "assets/images/resized/0025/5268/255268v2-max-250x250.jpg"], [[450, 255], "assets/images/resized/0025/5268/255268v2-max-450x450.jpg"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "http://blog.blockavenue.com/feed", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Boston", "description": "PayPal Start Tank", "address1": "1 International Place", "address2": "6th Floor", "longitude": null, "country_code": "USA", "latitude": null, "state_code": "MA", "zip_code": "02110"}], "phone_number": "408-461-7970", "description": "Neighborhood Social Radar", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "blockavenue", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": 7, "founded_year": 2012, "founded_month": null, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "blockavenue", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "BlockAvenue", "created_at": "Wed Aug 08 11:43:19 UTC 2012", "homepage_url": "http://BlockAvenue.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "http://blog.blockavenue.com", "tag_list": "hyperlocal, local, mobile, neighborhoods, travel, real-estate, city-data, big-data", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
