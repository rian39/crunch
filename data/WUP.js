Quickly find the best posts, places, people and products that really interest you. </p>\n\n<p>The mission of the WUP is to personalize the experience of each person in the search of information. The connections between the network profiles from our users will allow us to understand their real needs, to suggest relevant content. </p>\n\n<p>Every day thousands of people share and consume content on social media. There is plenty of useful data spread around the Web that\u2019s difficult to quickly find. We also pass the information age to the age of information overload. According to some studies are sent more than 340 million tweets per day where 71% are ignored. How can we find specific and reliable information in this scenario? </p>\n\n<p>We don\u2019t need another social network, because we already have a huge amount of personal information available online. What we need is to turn them into knowledge, and that\u2019s what WUP will do. </p>\n\n<p>WUP stores personal content from social media to analyse it, learn it and return the knowledge most valuable inside a context defined by the user. We can suggest, per example, most interesting places that your friends made check-ins. </p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 56], "assets/images/resized/0014/0555/140555v4-max-150x150.png"], [[200, 75], "assets/images/resized/0014/0555/140555v4-max-250x250.png"], [[200, 75], "assets/images/resized/0014/0555/140555v4-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Tue Jul 23 19:26:23 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "info@wup.co", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Brynner", "last_name": "Ferreira", "permalink": "brynner"}, "title": "Founder"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[150, 112], "assets/images/resized/0025/1663/251663v2-max-150x150.jpg"], [[250, 187], "assets/images/resized/0025/1663/251663v2-max-250x250.jpg"], [[450, 337], "assets/images/resized/0025/1663/251663v2-max-450x450.jpg"]], "attribution": null}, {"available_sizes": [[[150, 112], "assets/images/resized/0029/4785/294785v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 187], "assets/images/resized/0029/4785/294785v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 337], "assets/images/resized/0029/4785/294785v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": 1, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Fortaleza", "description": "", "address1": "", "address2": "", "longitude": null, "country_code": "BRA", "latitude": null, "state_code": null, "zip_code": ""}], "phone_number": "", "description": "Search on your interests.", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "wupco", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": 1, "founded_year": 2011, "founded_month": 1, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "wup", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "WUP", "created_at": "Wed Jun 22 21:05:57 UTC 2011", "homepage_url": "http://wup.co", "products": [{"permalink": "wup", "name": "WUP"}], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "social-search, social-media, big-data, ai, semantic-search, natural-language, mobile, guide, web-3-0", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
