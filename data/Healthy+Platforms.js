We create disease-specific destinations for these patients, while over time collecting real-time, actionable data that can be mapped and used to predict potential Quality of Life outcomes and distress. When a patient records a side effect, he or she will have the immediate confidence that a timely response will occur, according to the severity of that side effect. With patients generating recordings over time, the reporting capability and data aggregation will be of immense clinical value for these patients and the professionals caring for them. Predictive Analysis will create the ability to proactively manage the highest risk patients, which will lower costs and improve their quality of care.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 62], "assets/images/resized/0020/4077/204077v2-max-150x150.jpg"], [[250, 103], "assets/images/resized/0020/4077/204077v2-max-250x250.jpg"], [[450, 186], "assets/images/resized/0020/4077/204077v2-max-450x450.jpg"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Wed Apr 10 08:14:47 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "Charlie@cancerlife.net", "alias_list": "", "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Charlie", "last_name": "Coltman", "permalink": "charlie-coltman"}, "title": "Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Matthew", "last_name": "Kaufman", "permalink": "matthew-m-kaufman"}, "title": "CTO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Chris", "last_name": "Mattioli", "permalink": "chris-mattioli"}, "title": "Co-Founder"}, {"is_past": true, "person": {"first_name": "Pradeep", "last_name": "Kumar", "permalink": "pradeep-kumar-7"}, "title": "Chief Technology Officer"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Philadelphia", "description": "SeedPhilly", "address1": "1650 Arch Street", "address2": "", "longitude": null, "country_code": "USA", "latitude": null, "state_code": "PA", "zip_code": "19103"}, {"city": "Indiana", "description": "HealthyPlatforms R&D", "address1": "655 Church Street", "address2": "", "longitude": null, "country_code": "USA", "latitude": null, "state_code": "PA", "zip_code": "15701"}], "phone_number": "215-779-1238", "description": "Chronic disease management platform", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "HealthyPlatform", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": 3, "founded_year": 2010, "founded_month": 12, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "healthy-platforms", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "Healthy Platforms", "created_at": "Thu Aug 02 13:47:57 UTC 2012", "homepage_url": "http://healthyplatforms.com/", "products": [], "blog_url": "http://blog.healthyplatforms.com/", "tag_list": "cancer, emr, patient-engagement, big-data, ehealth, mobile-healthcare, umls, nlm, nih", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
