At a high level, GraphLab is the Hadoop of graphs.  By leveraging breakthroughs in system design, GraphLab scales from a laptop to an entire data-center, is compatible with existing Hadoop infrastructure, and delivers orders-of-magnitude performance gains over existing systems.</p>\n\n<p>This performance enables our users to process more data using fewer resources, respond more quickly to new information, and accelerate the cycle of innovation.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to performance, GraphLab provides end-to-end solutions:  Out of the box we include world-class data analytics and machine learning tools for a wide range of applications including product targeting, recommender systems, community detection, network security, text analysis, and computer vision.  Whether you want to recommend the perfect song or product for your users, detect anomalous activity in communication networks or payment transactions, or develop the latest technology to analyze social media, GraphLab provides a simple, highly scalable solution that has already changed how big data is processed.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 54], "assets/images/resized/0026/2192/262192v1-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 91], "assets/images/resized/0026/2192/262192v1-max-250x250.png"], [[410, 150], "assets/images/resized/0026/2192/262192v1-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Fri Nov 29 10:40:21 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [{"investments": [{"person": null, "company": null, "financial_org": {"permalink": "madrona-venture-group", "name": "Madrona Venture Group"}}, {"person": null, "company": null, "financial_org": {"permalink": "new-enterprise-associates", "name": "New Enterprise Associates"}}], "funded_month": 5, "source_description": "GraphLab Raises $6.75 Mln", "round_code": "a", "raised_amount": 6750000.0, "source_url": "http://www.pehub.com/201803/graphlab-raises-6-75-mln/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+pehub%2Fnews%2Fall+(PEHub+News)", "raised_currency_code": "USD", "funded_year": 2013, "funded_day": 14, "id": 37748}], "total_money_raised": "$6.75M", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "contact@graphlab.com", "alias_list": "", "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Carlos", "last_name": "Guestrin", "permalink": "carlos-guestrin"}, "title": "CEO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Danny", "last_name": "Bickson", "permalink": "danny-bickson"}, "title": "Co-Founder"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Seattle", "description": "", "address1": "", "address2": "", "longitude": -122.3320708, "country_code": "USA", "latitude": 47.6062095, "state_code": "WA", "zip_code": ""}], "phone_number": "", "description": "Large-Scale Machine Learning on Graphs", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "graphlabteam", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": null, "founded_year": 2013, "founded_month": 5, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "graphlab", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "GraphLab", "created_at": "Tue May 14 13:13:53 UTC 2013", "homepage_url": "http://graphlab.com/", "products": [], "blog_url": "http://graphlab.org/", "tag_list": "graph, graph-theory, machine-learning", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
