More and more companies are starting to recognize the importance of listening to what this Spanish and Spanglish speaking audience is saying about their company or brand.\nThis tool will effectively track, segment, and monitor real-time online conversations so our clients can make educated business decisions and develop culturally relevant communications with the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States. </p>\n\n<p>OYE! can provide affordable business intelligence solutions for brands, government agencies, political parties, nonprofit and educational organizations, PR agencies, and any other entity interested in communicating with Hispanics.</p>\n\n<p>Natasha Pongonis and Eric Diaz came up with the idea when they recognized an unfulfilled need when it came to online listening. They noticed that the current online listening tools did not cater to online conversations in Spanish and Spanglish, making online listening in Spanish very difficult and labor intensive. OYE! will make tracking and segmenting online conversations in Spanish easy and affordable for every business and organization interested in the U.S. Hispanic audience. </p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 62], "assets/images/resized/0030/9932/309932v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 104], "assets/images/resized/0030/9932/309932v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 187], "assets/images/resized/0030/9932/309932v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Fri Nov 01 23:21:37 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [{"investments": [{"person": null, "company": {"permalink": "10xelerator", "name": "10Xelerator"}, "financial_org": null}], "funded_month": 9, "source_description": "10xelerator", "round_code": "seed", "raised_amount": 20000.0, "source_url": "http://10xelerator.com/", "raised_currency_code": "USD", "funded_year": 2013, "funded_day": 4, "id": 52291}], "total_money_raised": "$20k", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Natasha", "last_name": "Pongonis", "permalink": "natasha-pongonis"}, "title": "Co-founder"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Eric", "last_name": "Diaz", "permalink": "eric-diaz-2"}, "title": "Co-founder"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Columbus", "description": "Columbus Office", "address1": "603 E.
