Packs work seamlessly with the iPhone and have at least one compatible app.</p>\n\n<p>Anvil&#8217;s first product is an ecommerce web-app called the Pack Store. It showcases and sells both the pack and the compatible app, and provides a direct link to Apple&#8217;s App Store. The Pack Store has 6 categories with hundreds of packs from toys &amp; games, to health &amp; athletics, and housewares.</p>\n\n<p>The Pack Store also has a reservation/pre-order category that helps pack developers gain exposure while in development, and guarantees distribution when they&#8217;re done.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 150], "assets/images/resized/0020/8662/208662v4-max-150x150.jpg"], [[250, 250], "assets/images/resized/0020/8662/208662v4-max-250x250.jpg"], [[450, 450], "assets/images/resized/0020/8662/208662v4-max-450x450.jpg"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Tue Jul 16 10:45:43 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Thomas", "last_name": "Marriott", "permalink": "thomas-marriott"}, "title": "Founder"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[126, 150], "assets/images/resized/0022/6480/226480v2-max-150x150.png"], [[211, 250], "assets/images/resized/0022/6480/226480v2-max-250x250.png"], [[380, 450], "assets/images/resized/0022/6480/226480v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, {"available_sizes": [[[150, 138], "assets/images/resized/0022/6481/226481v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 230], "assets/images/resized/0022/6481/226481v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 414], "assets/images/resized/0022/6481/226481v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, {"available_sizes": [[[107, 150], "assets/images/resized/0022/6482/226482v2-max-150x150.png"], [[179, 250], "assets/images/resized/0022/6482/226482v2-max-250x250.png"], [[323, 450], "assets/images/resized/0022/6482/226482v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, {"available_sizes": [[[63, 150], "assets/images/resized/0022/6483/226483v2-max-150x150.png"], [[106, 250], "assets/images/resized/0022/6483/226483v2-max-250x250.png"], [[191, 450], "assets/images/resized/0022/6483/226483v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Austin", "description": "", "address1": "", "address2": "", "longitude": null, "country_code": "USA", "latitude": null, "state_code": "TX", "zip_code": ""}], "phone_number": "", "description": "", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "Anvil", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": null, "founded_year": 2009, "founded_month": 3, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "anvil", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "Anvil", "created_at": "Wed Aug 29 10:19:53 UTC 2012", "homepage_url": "http://Anvil.net", "products": [{"permalink": "pack-store", "name": "Pack Store"}], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "packs, sensors, internet-of-things, quantified-self, mobile, big-data, embedded-systems, machine-learning, app-enabled, wearables", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
