Cornerstone is based on patent-pending technology that enables it to do three things better than any other Big Data analytics tool:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Automation of the Scientific Method to solve Big Data problems that are orders of magnitude more complex</li>\n<li>Application of the full-breadth of Cornerstone\u2019s groundbreaking technology to structured as well as unstructured Big Data</li>\n<li>Brand new comparative method based on Quantum Mechanics to extract an unparalleled depth of insight from Big Data</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Automation of the Scientific Method to solve Big Data problems that are orders of magnitude more complex:</p>\n\n<p>Cornerstone automates the core components of the Scientific Method which makes it more scalable and flexible than any other Big Data analytics tool.  This enables customers to solve much more complex research problems, delve many more layers deep into those problems than previously possible and dramatically reduce the number of man hours it takes to perform complex research.</p>\n\n<p>Application of the full-breadth of Cornerstone\u2019s groundbreaking technology to structured as well as unstructured Big Data:</p>\n\n<p>Cornerstone makes an innovative use of algorithms from Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence and Fuzzy Logic to enable a patent-pending process in which the vertical search function is performed in conjunction with the horizontal search function.  Because of this,  Cornerstone can analyze unstructured Big Data more robustly than any other Big Data analytics tool in the marketplace.</p>\n\n<p>Brand new comparative method based on Quantum Mechanics to extract an unparalleled depth of insight from Big Data:</p>\n\n<p>Cornerstone brings a groundbreaking new feature to Big Data analytics called the Comprehension Normalization Method.  Using Quantum Mechanics, we made a breakthrough in artificial intelligence by replicating a human form of comprehension in the virtual environment.  The Comprehension Normalization Method is a whole new comparative method that allows enterprise users to extract an unprecedented depth of insight from their Big Data.</p>\n\n<p>Use Cases:</p>\n\n<p>Since automation makes Cornerstone so flexible, it will benefit customers in a wide-range of industries:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pharmaceutical: Dramatically improve and speed up the drug discovery process</li>\n<li>Retail: Optimize marketing and pricing at the store and even customer-level</li>\n<li>Financial Services: Analyze historical trading patterns and predict future market trends</li>\n<li>Defense: Analyze enemy combatants\u2019 movements, behavior and other patterns</li>\n<li>Advertising: Build a detailed portrait of customers to serve them highly relevant ads</li>\n</ul>", "image": null, "updated_at": "Wed Aug 28 10:02:24 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "bosetins@gmail.com", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Bobby", "last_name": "Mannepalli", "permalink": "bobby-mannepalli"}, "title": "Co-founder & COO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Bridget", "last_name": "Osetinsky", "permalink": "bridget-osetinsky"}, "title": "Founder & CEO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Dr.", "last_name": "Abdul Aziz", "permalink": "dr-abdul-aziz"}, "title": "Co-Founder & CTO"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [], "founded_day": 16, "competitions": [{"competitor": {"permalink": "palantir-technologies", "name": "Palantir Technologies"}}, {"competitor": {"permalink": "gns-healthcare", "name": "GNS Healthcare"}}, {"competitor": {"permalink": "fina-technologies", "name": "Fina Technologies"}}, {"competitor": {"permalink": "dataspora-2", "name": "Dataspora"}}, {"competitor": {"permalink": "skytree", "name": "Skytree"}}, {"competitor": {"permalink": "sisense", "name": "SiSense"}}, {"competitor": {"permalink": "omniture", "name": "Omniture"}}], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [{"is_past": false, "provider": {"permalink": "patent-capital-group", "name": "Patent Capital Group"}, "title": "Intellectual Property Lawyers"}], "offices": [], "phone_number": "425-343-9282", "description": "Big Data Analytics Solutions", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": 3, "founded_year": 2010, "founded_month": 4, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "hyperfine", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "Hyperfine", "created_at": "Tue May 08 22:28:06 UTC 2012", "homepage_url": "http://Hyperfineglobal.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "big-data, internet, software, research, big-data-research, pharmaceuticals, medicine, diabetes, human-genome, cancer, scale, science-2-0, semantic-web, artificial-intelligence, cluster-functions, vertical-search, horizontal-search, k-means, america, pakis", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
