It has been built using big data technology which allows it to manage large amounts of devices with very low sample rates.</p>\n\n<p>The GroveStreams platform provides real-time analytic capabilities that can answer hard questions in real-time such as, &#8220;What is my current monthly winter-on-peak energy demand based on a meter that monitors 1 second ampere data?&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>GroveStreams does not sell sensors or other devices. It provides a public API where 3rd party devices can upload data. It strives to be a communication hub were real-time data from many sources can be brought together, in a secure environment, analyzed in near-real time while providing dashboard monitoring and notifications so that users and other devices can act on it.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 51], "assets/images/resized/0021/5613/215613v2-max-150x150.png"], [[240, 82], "assets/images/resized/0021/5613/215613v2-max-250x250.png"], [[240, 82], "assets/images/resized/0021/5613/215613v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Thu Sep 19 02:47:25 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "info@grovestreams.com", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Mike", "last_name": "Mills", "permalink": "mike-mills"}, "title": "Founder, CEO"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[150, 92], "assets/images/resized/0021/5611/215611v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 153], "assets/images/resized/0021/5611/215611v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 277], "assets/images/resized/0021/5611/215611v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, {"available_sizes": [[[150, 82], "assets/images/resized/0021/5612/215612v2-max-150x150.jpg"], [[250, 137], "assets/images/resized/0021/5612/215612v2-max-250x250.jpg"], [[450, 247], "assets/images/resized/0021/5612/215612v2-max-450x450.jpg"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": 26, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Maple Grove", "description": "", "address1": "", "address2": "", "longitude": -93.4557877, "country_code": "USA", "latitude": 45.0724642, "state_code": "MN", "zip_code": ""}], "phone_number": "", "description": "Internet of Things Platform", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "", "milestones": [{"stoned_month": 9, "stoned_value": null, "stoneable_type": "Company", "description": "GroveStreams leaves Beta.", "stoned_acquirer": null, "source_description": "", "stoneable": {"permalink": "grove-streams", "name": "Grove Streams"}, "source_url": "", "stoned_day": 16, "stoned_value_type": null, "source_text": null, "stoned_year": 2013, "id": 39879}], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": null, "founded_year": 2011, "founded_month": 1, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "grove-streams", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "Grove Streams", "created_at": "Mon Oct 15 17:46:12 UTC 2012", "homepage_url": "http://www.grovestreams.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "http://forum.grovestreams.com/forums/show/8.page", "tag_list": "internet-of-things, cloud, big-data, smart-grid, sensors, analytics, real-time, home-automation, web-of-things, business-intelligence", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
