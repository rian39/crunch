Its services include brand and product analysis, consumer lifestyle trend spotting, PR monitoring, CRM and risk management. Current clients include Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Hyundai Motors, Kia Motors, Korea Telecom and SK Networks.</p>\n\n<p>Daumsoft began as part of Daum Communications, Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top portal site, founded in 1995. Five years later, it was spun off as a separate company focused on search engine and natural language processing technology. It now incorporates these technologies into its service offerings to assesses how people feel about brands, products, public figures and even government policies. It can also identify consumer lifestyle trends and potential crises before they happen. </p>\n\n<p>Daumsoft uses Natural Language Processing to intelligently determine what a word or phrase means in context, much in the same way people analyze language. This approach is proven in many studies to be more accurate than systems that rely solely on preset list of words or phrases, ignoring how the words are used and failing to recognize possibilities outside of their programming. </p>\n\n<p>Currently Daumsoft offers analysis in English, Korean, Chinese, Japanese and Spanish.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 50], "assets/images/resized/0010/4703/104703v2-max-150x150.jpg"], [[250, 84], "assets/images/resized/0010/4703/104703v2-max-250x250.jpg"], [[382, 129], "assets/images/resized/0010/4703/104703v2-max-450x450.jpg"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Mon Oct 11 17:52:32 UTC 2010", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Young-jik", "last_name": "Lee", "permalink": "young-jik-lee"}, "title": "CCO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Kyeong-seo", "last_name": "Kim", "permalink": "kyeong-seo-kim"}, "title": "Chief Executive Officer"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Seong-hwan", "last_name": "Song", "permalink": "seong-hwan-song"}, "title": "Vice President"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Gil-yong", "last_name": "Song", "permalink": "gil-yong-song"}, "title": "Chief Strategoy Officer"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Joon-tae", "last_name": "Yoon", "permalink": "joon-tae-yoon"}, "title": "VP of R&D"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [], "founded_day": 10, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Seoul", "description": "Global Headquarters", "address1": "Seokgwang Bldg. 2F", "address2": "168-21 Samseong-dong, Gangnam-gu", "longitude": null, "country_code": "KOR", "latitude": null, "state_code": null, "zip_code": ""}, {"city": "Seoul", "description": "R&D Headquarters", "address1": "Wonseo Bldg.
