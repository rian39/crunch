Sclera&#8217;s flagship offering is an innovative development environment that abstracts away the underlying infrastructure as well as the tedious aspects of data processing, so that the developers can focus on the analytics tasks at hand. </p>\n\n<p>Sclera achieves this by: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Decoupling application development from the underlying infrastructure. The infrastructure can evolve incrementally, as needed, without affecting the application logic. </li>\n<li>Supporting familiar SQL extended with deep analytics capabilities. Recommendation engines, stock ticker analytics, customer behavior analysis, retail analytics, etc can be developed in just a few lines of code. Minimal technical training required. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For organizations evaluating the need for analytics, Sclera eliminates the effort and upfront investment required in evaluating ideas, verifying the ROI and &#8220;making the case&#8221;. </p>\n\n<p>For organizations who have already made investments in analytics systems (e.g. Hadoop/HBase), Sclera makes these systems accessible to SQL-savvy analysts and also enables easier interoperability with the SQL-based data warehouses and the existing BI ecosystem. </p>\n\n<p>To schedule a demonstration, please write to contact@scleradb.com.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 64], "assets/images/resized/0023/0613/230613v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 106], "assets/images/resized/0023/0613/230613v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 192], "assets/images/resized/0023/0613/230613v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Mon Apr 08 14:03:02 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "contact@scleradb.com", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Prasan", "last_name": "Roy", "permalink": "prasan-roy"}, "title": "Founder"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[150, 51], "assets/images/resized/0024/6638/246638v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 85], "assets/images/resized/0024/6638/246638v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 153], "assets/images/resized/0024/6638/246638v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, {"available_sizes": [[[150, 51], "assets/images/resized/0024/9492/249492v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 85], "assets/images/resized/0024/9492/249492v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 153], "assets/images/resized/0024/9492/249492v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [{"competitor": {"permalink": "cirro", "name": "Cirro"}}, {"competitor": {"permalink": "splice-machine", "name": "Splice Machine"}}], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Walnut", "description": "", "address1": "340 S Lemon Ave. #1728", "address2": "", "longitude": null, "country_code": "USA", "latitude": null, "state_code": "CA", "zip_code": "91789"}], "phone_number": "", "description": "Virtualized Advanced Analytics", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "scleradb", "milestones": [], "external_links": [{"title": "Product Overview", "external_url": "http://www.slideshare.net/Sclera/about-sclera-preview"}, {"title": "AngelList", "external_url": "http://angel.co/sclera-1"}], "number_of_employees": null, "founded_year": 2012, "founded_month": null, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "sclera", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "Sclera", "created_at": "Sat Jan 19 19:53:22 UTC 2013", "homepage_url": "http://scleradb.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "analytics, big-data, databases, virtualization, api-integration, systems-integration", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
