WikiDo&#8217;s proprietary search algorithm combs the Internet for events and activities within a given city, helping you to find activities to fill a lazy Sunday afternoon. You can find events for any city in the United States, and you can search for events on any day. Every two weeks, WikiDo crawls through more than 10 million different websites and finds nearly 700,000 events across the country.</p>\n\n<p>Each time you perform a WikiDo search for a particular city, you&#8217;ll receive a helpfully sorted list of events. Each result contains all the information you&#8217;ll need to participate in that event, and the result will also point you back to the event&#8217;s original website if you need additional information. You can also filter your results; if you&#8217;re only looking for concerts, for example, you can tell WikiDo to only show you concert events.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, individual users can edit events; users can leave feedback or add additional information to WikiDo&#8217;s post. If you have personal knowledge of a particular event and notice that WikiDo&#8217;s information isn&#8217;t completely accurate, you can edit the post so that other users will have the correct information. If WikiDo hasn&#8217;t found an event that you know about, you can manually add your event to WikiDo&#8217;s database. If you&#8217;re running an event that you don&#8217;t want WikiDo to advertise, you can also opt out of WikiDo&#8217;s service.</p>\n\n<p>Although WikiDo only serves the United States right now, its creators, Niccol\u00f2 and Giuseppe Becchi, plan to expand WikiDo in the near future. Eventually, the Becchi brothers dream of covering the whole world, allowing users to find fun and exciting events no matter where they live. </p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 135], "assets/images/resized/0022/4762/224762v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 225], "assets/images/resized/0022/4762/224762v2-max-250x250.png"], [[269, 243], "assets/images/resized/0022/4762/224762v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Tue Jul 23 15:06:12 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "staff@wikido.com", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Niccol\u00f2", "last_name": "Becchi", "permalink": "niccol-becchi"}, "title": "Cofounder"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Giuseppe", "last_name": "Becchi", "permalink": "giuseppe-becchi"}, "title": "Cofounder"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [{"available_sizes": [[[150, 93], "assets/images/resized/0022/4760/224760v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 156], "assets/images/resized/0022/4760/224760v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 281], "assets/images/resized/0022/4760/224760v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, {"available_sizes": [[[150, 93], "assets/images/resized/0022/4761/224761v2-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 156], "assets/images/resized/0022/4761/224761v2-max-250x250.png"], [[450, 281], "assets/images/resized/0022/4761/224761v2-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}], "founded_day": 1, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [], "phone_number": "", "description": "Search engine for events", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "WikiDo_com", "milestones": [], "external_links": [{"title": "What's up today?", "external_url": "http://www.pressking.com/press-releases/What-s-up-today-WikiDo-looks-for-it-for-you--031481"}, {"title": "", "external_url": "http://startuptunes.com/2013/02/02/wikido-find-your-event-now/"}], "number_of_employees": 2, "founded_year": 2011, "founded_month": 8, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "wikido", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "WikiDo", "created_at": "Mon Dec 10 22:58:01 UTC 2012", "homepage_url": "http://www.wikido.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "search, entertainments, data-mining, events, mobile", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
