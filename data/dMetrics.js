The result is a dynamic interest graph, helping companies and individuals make better decisions about products to use, campaigns to run, and companies to invest in. Our clients (from Fortune 500 to non-profits) use dMetrics to get the most accurate, unbiased, and transparent view of people\u2019s actions, tracing decision making all the way from high-level market insights to high-value discussions.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding what people do - and why - is the next frontier of text analytics. Clicks, Likes and Retweets do not representatively convey the voice of the consumer, comprising a tiny portion of the information contributed by Internet users. Most of the Internet (other than photos of kittens) is conversational: blog posts, forum discussions, Twitter dialogues. Our platform extracts consumer decisions from billions of online conversations. So far, our work in healthcare has resulted in the largest database of healthcare-centric insights about 14,000+ products. Similar repositories of consumer insights for CPG, telecom, and banking industries are underway.</p>\n\n<p>We liberate our clients from the confines of sentiment analysis, word clouds, topic modeling, and fixed dictionaries - shallow tools for the rich world of online conversations. Our work has been cited in over 4,500 academic publications. Our technology has received five consecutive National Science Foundation SBIR awards.</p>", "image": {"available_sizes": [[[150, 43], "assets/images/resized/0031/5117/315117v8-max-150x150.png"], [[250, 71], "assets/images/resized/0031/5117/315117v8-max-250x250.png"], [[254, 73], "assets/images/resized/0031/5117/315117v8-max-450x450.png"]], "attribution": null}, "updated_at": "Tue Aug 27 20:27:49 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [{"investments": [{"person": {"first_name": "Evan", "last_name": "Schulman", "permalink": "evan-schulman"}, "company": null, "financial_org": null}, {"person": {"first_name": "Nicholas", "last_name": "Negroponte", "permalink": "nicholas-negroponte"}, "company": null, "financial_org": null}], "funded_month": null, "source_description": "", "round_code": "angel", "raised_amount": 2300000.0, "source_url": "", "raised_currency_code": "USD", "funded_year": 2011, "funded_day": null, "id": 46879}, {"investments": [{"person": null, "company": null, "financial_org": {"permalink": "national-science-foundation", "name": "National Science Foundation"}}], "funded_month": null, "source_description": "", "round_code": "grant", "raised_amount": 1300000.0, "source_url": "", "raised_currency_code": "USD", "funded_year": 2013, "funded_day": null, "id": 46880}], "total_money_raised": "$3.6M", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "info@dmetrics.com", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Nemirovsky, PhD", "permalink": "paul-nemirovsky-phd"}, "title": "Co-Founder & CEO"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Ariadna", "last_name": "Quattoni, PhD", "permalink": "ariadna-quattoni-phd"}, "title": "Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Doogan", "permalink": "stephen-doogan-2"}, "title": "VP Business Development"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Gabriele", "last_name": "Musillo, PhD", "permalink": "gabriele-musillo-phd"}, "title": "Director of Research & Development"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Gregory", "last_name": "Begelman, PhD", "permalink": "gregory-begelman-phd"}, "title": "Director of Engineering"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [], "founded_day": null, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Brooklyn", "description": "", "address1": "181 North 11th St", "address2": "", "longitude": null, "country_code": "USA", "latitude": null, "state_code": "NY", "zip_code": "11211"}], "phone_number": "646 688-5923", "description": "Data Mining and Analytics", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "dMetricsInc", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": null, "founded_year": 2009, "founded_month": null, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "dmetrics", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "dMetrics", "created_at": "Tue Aug 27 15:29:57 UTC 2013", "homepage_url": "http://dmetrics.com", "products": [], "blog_url": "", "tag_list": "data-mining, analytics, big-data-analytics", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
