This in turn gives the customer the information that is needed to optimize specific searches via adwords and examine assisted conversions over periods of time.</p>\n\n<p>Dynamic Call-Tracking automatically changes the phone number on the webpage with a tracking number. When the customer calls the tracking number he is redirected to the regular number, while the phone call is registered. Combining this with tracking information from the internet, like Google Analytics Cookie, you get a clear view of leads and conversions received by phone.</p>\n\n<p>Call-Tracking can be set up and start gathering data in roughly 5 minutes. </p>", "image": null, "updated_at": "Thu Jul 11 22:39:12 UTC 2013", "funding_rounds": [], "total_money_raised": "$0", "deadpooled_day": null, "email_address": "info@telemetric.dk", "alias_list": null, "relationships": [{"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Asser", "last_name": "Schr\u00f8der Fem\u00f8", "permalink": "asser-schrder-fem"}, "title": "Partner / Co-Founder"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Janus", "last_name": "Lindau", "permalink": "janus-lindau"}, "title": "Partner / Co-Founder"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Mads-Emil", "last_name": "Gellert Larsen", "permalink": "mads-emil-gellert-larsen"}, "title": "Partner / Co-Founder"}, {"is_past": false, "person": {"first_name": "Mikkel", "last_name": "Bach Mortensen", "permalink": "mikkel-bach-mortensen"}, "title": "Partner / Co-Founder"}], "partners": [], "screenshots": [], "founded_day": 1, "competitions": [], "blog_feed_url": "", "providerships": [], "offices": [{"city": "Copenhagen", "description": "Telemetric HQ", "address1": "Linnesgade 33", "address2": "", "longitude": null, "country_code": "DNK", "latitude": null, "state_code": null, "zip_code": "1361"}], "phone_number": "+45 7879 2222", "description": "Delivers services like Call-Tracking", "deadpooled_year": null, "ipo": null, "twitter_username": "TelemetricDK", "milestones": [], "external_links": [], "number_of_employees": null, "founded_year": 2012, "founded_month": 9, "acquisitions": [], "permalink": "telemetric-call-tracking", "deadpooled_url": null, "name": "Telemetric Call-Tracking", "created_at": "Wed Jul 10 15:00:53 UTC 2013", "homepage_url": "http://www.telemetric.dk", "products": [], "blog_url": "http://telemetric.dk/blog", "tag_list": "call-tracking, marketing, advertising, romi, roi, data-driven-marketing, big-data", "investments": [], "acquisition": null}
