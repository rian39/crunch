Socure's Social Biometrics(TM) solution adds a novel social twist to realtime identity verification and fraud detection to defend enterprises against identity fraud.

The rise of social media and efforts to monetize consumer data through marketing and advertising has resulted in the easy availability of our personal information such as mother's maiden name, favorite pet's name, place of birth etc. on the Internet today. It's no surprise then that identity fraud is now growing faster than world trade in some countries. In the US alone, $48 Billion was lost by financial institutions to identity fraud last year. In fact most tier-1 financial institutions are losing an average of over $100 Million per year per institution despite the fraud detection technologies implemented over the last decade. There are impacts to society beyond financial loss as a result of identity fraud. The problem is global.

Socure Social Biometrics(TM) uses the power of social attestation -- the process that goes on when we interact with our family, friends, peers and followers in unique ways -- as a way to improve identity verification and identity fraud detection in realtime. Socure's team of machine learning experts have created powerful patent pending algorithms and linked data processing techniques to extract this social attestation signal in realtime. This additive signal to existing fraud detection solutions reduces fraud losses, false positives and negatives as well as fraud-mitigation call center overhead; all of which impact an enterprise's top and bottom line. Unlike other types of biometric solutions, Social Biometrics(TM) does not require any training or change of behavior on the consumer's part. An enterprise can be social or traditional and still derive the benefits of our proven solution. 

Identity proofing drives everything in credit and commerce today and forms the under-pinnings of social-commerce around the world tomorrow.",socure

PoliRoots is the first interactive service to have infrastructure that incorporates social networking for volunteers, big data analysis, and an online GOTV package for political campaigns.


Why it's necessary?

Why we would deliver?
Campaigning never stops. There is an election every year, the two biggest being a presidential election year and a midterm year. Campaigns are looking for new, easier ways to make their campaigns more efficient. President Obama's tech team used data-mining and predictive analytics as a way to reach out to more voters.

eblizz is a white label platform that is embedded into a website and seamlessly integrates social networks (now facebook) into it. Users can interact both with the website content and their social network friends onsite and use the drag-and-drop function to share items, make recommendations, make purchases, collect photos etc.
The eblizz services include a social analytics platform designed to collect contextual data that is specific to a website's audience, content and activities.  The analytics give companies a detailed snapshot of the user, how and where the content was spread, where purchases are made, and number of downloads.   This enables a company to effectively incorporate this data-mining into their WOM marketing strategy.
The focus of eblizz is to help companies with an online presence optimize the marketing power of the Social Web. 

Product Differentiation

How do we differ from all the share buttons out there? The focus of share buttons is to grab a piece of content and push it to the userâ€™s stream, in essence attempting to syndicate that to as many users as possible. Use of share buttons started to gain momentum in 2009. What we see now, however, is that the user's news feeds are spammed with content that becomes less and less relevant. eblizz has a different approach â€“ allowing brand sites and social networks to work together in a way that enables the social networks to become a part of each brand's site and vice versa. 
eblizz also makes it possible for users to share content in a fun way AND directly interact with their social network while on the companyâ€™s web site â€“ that is the key. They can, for example, read their news stream and drop a product from the site directly into the news stream or post comments. The idea is to keep them on a website as long as possible and to allow them to interact with the site's content in an exciting way. 
Additionally users can store the products they find in what is called the Shoebox. In the Shoebox they have a variety of options to manipulate the stored content and share from within the Shoebox.

Revenue Model

eblizz will generate revenue through a fixed-price models with monthly fees. Alternative pricing models such as commission-based revenue generation will be explored.

Phase II â€“ Build-Out of Application
The Drag-and-Drop link below provides a video demonstration of the application that is in beta testing today.  eblizz seeks $500,000 for Second Stage financing to build out the application - here is a sneak peak of what is coming next:
â€¢	Making the core products stronger.  This will include the ability for live chat on a companyâ€™s website, meaning that users can directly chat with their facebook friends on the web site discussing the companyâ€™s products.
â€¢	Extend the companyâ€™s products to facebook itself, so products are showcased on facebook as part of a facebook application. Each user will, through his/her actions, automatically create a mini-shop that shows his/her favorite products.

â€¢	Improve overall employee health. More than just a cost issue, employee health impacts every aspect of a business, from fewer absences and disability claims to improved performance and productivity.

How do we do it?  
HOW uses its proprietary technology to help clients stay a step ahead of health care expenses by:
â€¢	Identifying at-risk members
â€¢	Analyzing provider data to easily discover the most optimal health care solutions
â€¢	Encouraging low-cost, proactive health care to reduce the likelihood of surgery 
â€¢	Recommending affordable healthcare and surgical options around the world
â€¢	Helping members take advantage of preventive care and wellness programs

How does our system work? 
We create a secure and HIPAA compliant personal electronic health record for each employee or member. Next, using our state-of-the-art predictive algorithms and data-mining techniques, we identify expensive patients and deploy preventive clinical programs to keep them healthy and out of the hospital. 

What are the results? 
Working with HOW, clients help their employees or members prevent or reverse chronic diseases, greatly reducing the likelihood of expensive future surgical intervention. ",health-options-worldwide

Panjiva hosts a database of information on over 700,000 suppliers, including recent shipments, customer lists, credit reports, certification details, and denied parties lists. It claims to be the first and only online information source designed to provide complete transparency into overseas suppliers. According Jeff Silberman, chair of the department of textile development and marketing at New York's Fashion Institute of Technology ""Panjiva is not just innovative, it's revolutionary""[1]

By collecting market data from suppliers, Panjiva is also able to produce details of trends within sectors. Information published by Panjiva has been used by news websites such as FT.com[2] and CNNMoney.com[3].

Founding

Josh Green was working at an electronics company in Summer of 2005 when he was asked to find a replacement for one of the company's existing suppliers. ""Naively, I thought this would be easy"" said Panjiva co-founder Green, ""but I soon discovered two things. First, that there is no shortage of information about companies on the web. And second, that almost none of it is either objective or useful in identifying trustworthy suppliers. When I talked the problem over with my MIT friend Jim Psota, Panjiva was born.""

Naming

Panjiva started out with the name ""GlobalReferenceCheck,"" but sensing that a new name might simplify branding and marketing, co-founders Green and Psota played on Pangaea, the word for the supercontinent that existed before the component continents were separated into their current configuration, to arrive at Panjiva.",panjiva

WikiDo's proprietary search algorithm combs the Internet for events and activities within a given city, helping you to find activities to fill a lazy Sunday afternoon. You can find events for any city in the United States, and you can search for events on any day. Every two weeks, WikiDo crawls through more than 10 million different websites and finds nearly 700,000 events across the country.

Each time you perform a WikiDo search for a particular city, you'll receive a helpfully sorted list of events. Each result contains all the information you'll need to participate in that event, and the result will also point you back to the event's original website if you need additional information. You can also filter your results; if you're only looking for concerts, for example, you can tell WikiDo to only show you concert events.

Additionally, individual users can edit events; users can leave feedback or add additional information to WikiDo's post. If you have personal knowledge of a particular event and notice that WikiDo's information isn't completely accurate, you can edit the post so that other users will have the correct information. If WikiDo hasn't found an event that you know about, you can manually add your event to WikiDo's database. If you're running an event that you don't want WikiDo to advertise, you can also opt out of WikiDo's service.

Although WikiDo only serves the United States right now, its creators, Niccolò and Giuseppe Becchi, plan to expand WikiDo in the near future. Eventually, the Becchi brothers dream of covering the whole world, allowing users to find fun and exciting events no matter where they live.

Operating at the forefront of natural language processing, our team of MIT PhDs has built a platform to analyze thousands of social networks, blogs, and forums, identifying and connecting people, their decisions about products, and rationale for these decisions. The result is a dynamic interest graph, helping companies and individuals make better decisions about products to use, campaigns to run, and companies to invest in. Our clients (from Fortune 500 to non-profits) use dMetrics to get the most accurate, unbiased, and transparent view of people’s actions, tracing decision making all the way from high-level market insights to high-value discussions.

Understanding what people do - and why - is the next frontier of text analytics. Clicks, Likes and Retweets do not representatively convey the voice of the consumer, comprising a tiny portion of the information contributed by Internet users. Most of the Internet (other than photos of kittens) is conversational: blog posts, forum discussions, Twitter dialogues. Our platform extracts consumer decisions from billions of online conversations. So far, our work in healthcare has resulted in the largest database of healthcare-centric insights about 14,000+ products. Similar repositories of consumer insights for CPG, telecom, and banking industries are underway.

We liberate our clients from the confines of sentiment analysis, word clouds, topic modeling, and fixed dictionaries - shallow tools for the rich world of online conversations.

You, your applications and your customers are creating Big Data all the time – even if you don't realise it. And right now companies are using Big Data analytics to illuminate parts of their business where previously they had had little or no insight. Big Data attributes can account for human relationships and personal preferences – they can describe products, predict consumer choices, show you who people are, where they go and what they do, what they like and don't like.
 
The skill is in making sense of that data, and doing so enables you to solve business problems that, in the past, just couldn't be solved. Big Data data can be aggregated and mined through Hadoop, NoSQL (Not only Structured Query Language), graph database, or other big-data platforms which search for patterns. It means it's now perfectly possible to analyse entire data sets rather than just subsets; it means analysing much more detailed data – and this increase in the data you have at your disposal can be a massive business advantage.
 
Big Data applications are increasingly deployed in business processes – such as customer experience optimization, multichannel conversation management, and behaviorally targeted offers – that are dynamic, contextual and situational in nature. Big Data Analysis allows you to access your data in near-real time and make decisions and adjust business plans accordingly. Instead of basing your decisions on the past - on your historical data – you can now base them on the present.
 
If you don't want your business to be left behind, if you want to compete – now and in the future – you need to use this vast stream of data to your advantage. That's where we come in: we have experts who understand the situation, understand business and value creation, and can build the technical setup that delivers your ideal Big Data business solution.
 
We offer you the opportunity to gain a competitive advantage, allowing you to react more quickly and base your business strategy decisions on information you never had before – we enable you, for the first time, to use Big Data to make the kind of strategic business decisions that can transform your business.

These solutions employ Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), mobile and big data technologies.

When Aconex was founded in 2000, construction was one of the few industries that still relied on paper for the exchange of project information. Then, as now, capital projects generated thousands of documents and items of correspondence to be shared and managed among hundreds of project team members, often in different geographic regions. 

Multiparty project information management using email, spreadsheets, FTP sites, and generic file sharing software tends to be time-consuming, prone to human error, lacking in security, and unauditable. The result is increased project delivery risk leading to schedule delays, cost overruns and even disputes.

The Aconex platform was developed as a solution for document management on construction projects, leveraging the power of the internet to streamline communications, improve collaboration and mitigate risk. The platform was designed in consultation with industry professionals to reflect industry best practices for process control and information management. The company emphasized client adoption, service and support to ensure that users learned the system quickly and selected it for other projects. 

Since then, the Aconex platform has become the most widely used online project collaboration solution in its target markets, with a total of 300,000 users to date. The company has served more than 12,000 projects, valued at $700 billion, in over 70 countries, on landmark developments throughout Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North and South America, Australia, and New Zealand.

Aconex clients include nine of the world’s top ten engineering procurement and construction (EPC/EPCM) firms, 23 of the 25 largest global design firms, and nearly all Fortune 500 construction and engineering firms.

Synthesys does not rely upon predefined models to make sense of the data (i.e. exhaustive extraction or ontology-type models).

-promote their LykeBox presence via the LykeWidget or Lyke Display ads
-get analytics on which social messages and channels are most effective
-create deals, alerts, games, &  polls to further engage their Lykers

The solution can be deployed stand-alone using Walkbase sensors or leveraging WiFi infrastructure already installed in a building. Consumer’s unique Wi-Fi identifiers (MAC addresses) are hashed to ensure data privacy protection.
 
Our retail analytics dashboard shows traffic trends by store and, given a larger installation, within departments inside a store. Capture rate (percent of passers by entering) can be measured, along with dwell time by store or zone and proportion of loyal repeat customers. This allows comparisons across time and different stores in a chain – all valuable information for a store or retail chain manager to identify opportunities to improve customer service and conversions to sales.
 
Marketing teams can measure footfall changes in response to general or store-specific advertising campaigns, providing an understanding of whether campaigns are generating traffic. The Walkbase integration with Google Universal Analytics allows our customers to combine data from campaigns with footfall data and view it side-by-side (available in beta). Further, retailers launching mobile applications for their customers can use the Walkbase real-time API to personalise the app experience based on location and (with opt-in) customer profile.

Socialyzer Founder Bradley Joyce had come across a problem. He would be reading blogs and news about startups and entrepreneurship and want to share those articles with his followers, but he didn't want to spam them all at once with the 10 things he had just read.

So he tried a few services that would allow him to schedule his tweets. Bradley, however, also wanted to be able to schedule posts to Facebook and LinkedIn... and do it automatically without having to set specific times.

No other service offered this, so Bradley decided to pitch the idea at Dallas Startup Weekend. Out of 40 pitches, the Socialyzer idea didn't make it into the top 10 after a vote for which ideas to pursue over the weekend.

Undeterred, however, a few good hackers decided to join up with Bradley anyway, rebel, and form a rogue team! Over the next 35 hours, the team churned out hundreds of lines of code, whipped up the design, and by the final day of Startup Weekend, launched Socialyzer (original called Queued.at)

The judges of the event, recognizing this incredible feat and seeing the service as one of the most complete and polished products of the weekend, awarded first prize to the Socialyzer team!

We continue to build out, improve and expand the Socialyzer service and won't stop until we can easily and effectively tell you what you should post, to which social network and at what time while accurately predicting the engagement on each post!

Cornerstone is based on patent-pending technology that enables it to do three things better than any other Big Data analytics tool:

1. Automation of the Scientific Method to solve Big Data problems that are orders of magnitude more complex
2. Application of the full-breadth of Cornerstone’s groundbreaking technology to structured as well as unstructured Big Data
3. Brand new comparative method based on Quantum Mechanics to extract an unparalleled depth of insight from Big Data

Automation of the Scientific Method to solve Big Data problems that are orders of magnitude more complex:

Cornerstone automates the core components of the Scientific Method which makes it more scalable and flexible than any other Big Data analytics tool.  This enables customers to solve much more complex research problems, delve many more layers deep into those problems than previously possible and dramatically reduce the number of man hours it takes to perform complex research.

Application of the full-breadth of Cornerstone’s groundbreaking technology to structured as well as unstructured Big Data:

Cornerstone makes an innovative use of algorithms from Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence and Fuzzy Logic to enable a patent-pending process in which the vertical search function is performed in conjunction with the horizontal search function.  Because of this,  Cornerstone can analyze unstructured Big Data more robustly than any other Big Data analytics tool in the marketplace.

Brand new comparative method based on Quantum Mechanics to extract an unparalleled depth of insight from Big Data:

Cornerstone brings a groundbreaking new feature to Big Data analytics called the Comprehension Normalization Method.  Using Quantum Mechanics, we made a breakthrough in artificial intelligence by replicating a human form of comprehension in the virtual environment.  The Comprehension Normalization Method is a whole new comparative method that allows enterprise users to extract an unprecedented depth of insight from their Big Data.

Use Cases:

Since automation makes Cornerstone so flexible, it will benefit customers in a wide-range of industries:
* Pharmaceutical: Dramatically improve and speed up the drug discovery process
* Retail: Optimize marketing and pricing at the store and even customer-level
* Financial Services: Analyze historical trading patterns and predict future market trends
* Defense: Analyze enemy combatants’ movements, behavior and other patterns

With lifeAssist™, producers store all of their policy data in one secure location, allowing the system to continuously analyze each policy and determine whether or not it is sustainable and whether there is a better alternative. Whenever an opportunity is identified, which occurs with about 25% of in-force policies, a client-ready report is generated, illustrating the short and long term cost implications of the client’s current plan versus alternatives and using proprietary logic to explain a set of recommendations. This gives producers the opportunity to catch policies before they lapse, and generate a sale, without requiring a heavy commitment of their time. 

With a shrinking and aging broker force, fewer agents are available to service policies, and the pool of ‘orphan’ policyholders has risen dramatically. In addition, insurance professionals need to be made aware of the problems within their inforce book of business and need to know how to order and analyze in-force data and make appropriate recommendations.

Today, big data is the crucial in many applications areas from academic to businesses. Dealing with big data is not an easy issue. It is not only about the statistical software, we have the open source R, and the powerful hardware, we can easily have 1000 of instances with cloud providers; it is all about the ease-of-use, the cost and the experience. 

Commercial cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) promote its simple and fast access to general computing and hosting. But this is not true for most of the academicians and enterprises. You need at least an expert to spend some hours to setup the R statistical environment before your analysis. And it is just an instance. If you have computation intensive analysis, you will need a cluster of sereval instances with different layers of big data stacks. All the installation and configuration are becoming more and more complex. We’re just data analysts. We just want to focus on data analysis. Why is it so hard? And end out nothing after some days of hardwork and resources wasted?

KloudStat, a cloud integrated development environment for open source R, provides the academicians and enterprises the platform to perform and focus on big data analytic processes that are critical in decision making without dealing with the backend production environment, such that KloudStat as a fast, scalable, distributed system can start with on a single server within a minute and expand to a cluster of instances optimized for each tier, i.e. R clusters, Hadoop clusters, databases and application servers of the system automatically. 

Besides giving the freedom of data intelligence to everyone at anywhere, anytime across multiple platforms, KloudStat’s collaboration feature allows a small group of collaborators can interact and do statistical analyses real-time with the virtual console, finally the source editing while all will be completely synchronize with local R software. 

KloudStat’s most interesting feature would be the modules or more advanced, big data applications development, which allows developers to implement the statistics engine in R with KloudStat APIs, while envolved in a top layer defined like a user interface. The main layer coordinates the lower layers where different engines based on several architectures are implemented. Each modules or applications created that contains many features are for specific task or purpose. These modules or apps allows faster data analysis and for everyone even don’t have programming knowledge. 

KloudStat was built based on Rstudio server with pre-configured big data stacks, such as Hadoop. You can start analyzing your data as soon as you login to your console dashboard, no cluster configuration needed as all is automated and optimized. So far, the user had to start his R session with special MPI command. MPI binding is automatically created in the background and you can start your computer cluster using the packages snow, Rmpi or foreach without any additional steps.

These services completely free developers from dealing with nodes, clusters, scaling, data-persistence and failure recovery, while providing true auto-scalability and instant failover.
Redis, an in-memory, open-source NoSQL database, is taking the developer community by storm, while Memcached, an in-memory, open-source caching system, has powered demanding infrastructures for years. However, both suffer from severe limitations in the areas of high-availability, scalability and performance stability, making the open-source products insufficient for users requiring robust and stable data store solutions, such as enterprises.   

Garantia Data overcomes these limitations by adding its breakthrough dynamic-clustering technological layer to open source Redis and Memcached. The technology virtualizes multiple cloud servers into a self-aware memory fabric that enables infinite seamless scalability, true high-availability (including in-memory replications and auto-failover mechanisms), top stable performance and zero management.   

In February 2013 the company announced general availability of its services. It currently hosts thousands of active customers’ databases and experiences rapid growth. The company has been highly praised by analysts, media and its customers. Garantia Data also frequently appears in lists of outstanding companies and technologies, including Gartner: ""Cool Vendor"" 2013 In-Memory Computing,  CRN: “Big Data 100” and Network World: “10 of the most useful cloud databases"" .

At the peak of recession in 2009, Zuna Infotech was founded with the aim to provide jobs to the highly skilled IT workforce in the US by opening its delivery centers in low cost areas in the Midwest. With lower costs, highly skilled workforce, strong processes, excellent location advantage and collaborative mind-set, Zuna became the pioneer in Onshore Outsourcing.

At Zuna our technology solutions are focused on achieving the business objectives of our customers. Our teams have deep-rooted enterprise experience, strong process-orientation, and experience across technology domains and industry verticals. Our competency centers are driven by the Practice approach, with knowledge management and retention, value creation and excellence at the heart of the Practice.

Zuna is committed to providing jobs to the US workforce. We are committed to training, mentoring and building viable long-term careers. We are committed to our customers, and stand true to our motto of Commitment, Quality and Value.",zuna-infotech

The company’s flagship software platform, Microgen Aptitude, is termed an Enterprise Application Platform that is used by enterprises to quickly design and develop software applications. 

The Microgen Aptitude platform provides a comprehensive range of components including a business rules engine, BPMS, data and application integration, in-database processing and web workflow development. 

The Microgen Aptitude platform is unique in several ways. First, Microgen Aptitude’s all graphical approach to development enables cross-functional teams, including Business and IT users, to collaboratively develop business applications. 

Second, by providing a comprehensive set of components within a single development environment, Microgen Aptitude reduces the need for development cycles used to bolt together disparate technologies. 

Finally, Microgen Aptitude is capable of processing hundreds of millions of transactions per hour, without the need for the usual complex code optimisation cycles. Microgen Aptitude leverages in-memory processing. The platform’s common execution environment equals the performance of modern hard-coded applications but scales without the usual extensive code reconfiguration required to meet increased performance demands. 

Microgen is also recognised for its expertise in the areas of finance integration with the Microgen Accounting Hub product.

Examples of applications built using Microgen technology platforms include custom finance systems for large banks, royalty management systems for digital media companies, new digital services for education and utilities clients, and operations platforms for trust and fund administrators.

A publisher’s own data, third party data, and analysis of trading/user behaviour are used to choose the content that is most relevant to an individual user – automating the auction, selection and transaction. 

To date, Switch has applied this platform to online display advertising and marketing. Switch’s real-time decision engine outperforms today's adservers and fully integrates real-time bidding (RTB) – enabling direct, ad network and RTB sales to compete for each impression. Switch is the first Holistic Adserving Solution.  Trading Analytics are fed back into the decision engine which can access data from multiple sources during its decision including the dynamic floor prices and target audience segments output from Switch’s big data tools. 

Switch works on behalf of publishers: exposing their ad inventory (and extensions to include third party inventory) to the maximum level of competing demand; managing floor prices to optimize revenue; and, making full use of data whilst protecting it from leakage.

1. Not local enough and chronologically sparse.
2. One-way only: additional feedback and details from the data source cannot be asked.

Sclera achieves this by: 
1. Decoupling application development from the underlying infrastructure. The infrastructure can evolve incrementally, as needed, without affecting the application logic. 
2. Supporting familiar SQL extended with deep analytics capabilities. Recommendation engines, stock ticker analytics, customer behavior analysis, retail analytics, etc can be developed in just a few lines of code. Minimal technical training required. 

For organizations evaluating the need for analytics, Sclera eliminates the effort and upfront investment required in evaluating ideas, verifying the ROI and ""making the case"". 

For organizations who have already made investments in analytics systems (e.g. Hadoop/HBase), Sclera makes these systems accessible to SQL-savvy analysts and also enables easier interoperability with the SQL-based data warehouses and the existing BI ecosystem.

The deep reduction of costs combined with the enhanced performance capabilities offered by the new product makes constellations of many satellites financially viable, thus enabling operational services and creating new applications. This has been achieved by utilizing the state of art terrestrial microelectronic and micro-system-technologies.

Based on Dauria’s satellite technologies, the company is planning to deploy constellations of various earth observation and communications satellites to provide frequent vegetation monitoring for precision farming, traffic management, dynamic urban management and polar broadband services. The company works closely with the national governments on the joint financing of these space projects making it possible for the private seed investment to cover a significantly larger range of services. These services will be further enhanced by making them available in a unique service eco-system where they can be combined with other satellite resources and advanced software applications through a cloud based platform - CloudEO. This will foster a new era where space applications enter humans’ daily lives. 

CloudEO offers to its customers a secure and highly scalable Geo-Infrastructure to develop, produce and market geo-services. It brings data, software and processing power together within a private cloud environment at a certified hoster. It removes todays prevailing entry barriers to establish affordable geo-services.

Within CloudEO's Geo-Collaboration platform new business models favouring value based pricing and risk and profit sharing are realized. Thus CloudEO is a unique incubation centre for geo-services. It lets all players within the value adding chain, the data provider, the software developer, the value adder, the service provider and the customers of geo-services become partners within a healthy ecosystem. 
Instead of the current rather small, project driven market a growing geo-market for commercial applications is stimulated.

CloudEO Product Portfolio: As first CloudEO Geo-Infrastructure Services, the CloudEO Workbench and the CloudEO Store are released in their beta version to selected users. The launch is planned within Q4. With the launch on CloudEO Geo-infrastructure already a comprehensive offering of content and software services will be available.",dauria-aerospace

The solution helps you by keeping track of conversions that happen through the phone, helping customers to optimise the marketing effort and the ROI of their advertisement.

Call-Tracking tracks conversions across all sources. This in turn gives the customer the information that is needed to optimize specific searches via adwords and examine assisted conversions over periods of time.

Dynamic Call-Tracking automatically changes the phone number on the webpage with a tracking number. When the customer calls the tracking number he is redirected to the regular number, while the phone call is registered. Combining this with tracking information from the internet, like Google Analytics Cookie, you get a clear view of leads and conversions received by phone.

Call-Tracking can be set up and start gathering data in roughly 5 minutes.

The Solution.

TaggPic technology is based solely on visual features, and does not require any metadata, such as GPS tags, manual tagging, or other location sensors, although it is capable of working with inputs from all three. The underlying algorithms can determine the precise position of the camera viewpoint in a geo-referenced coordinate system, even if no prior data about the photo’s location is known.

TaggPic transforms static 2D photos into auto-tagged, geo-positioned, and intelligently connected platforms. TaggPic’s crowd-fueled computer vision technology instantly recognizes landmarks, buildings, and other objects in images without the need for GPS data or manual tagging.",taggpic

SNTMNT is developing online sentiment analysis and prediction tools that make financial sentiment in word-of-mouth surrounding stocks tangible. This way it helps investors make better investment decisions. 

SNTMNT is offering three products: 

- Trading Indicator API
Multiple studies over the past years have shown that Twitter sentiment can be used as an indicator for future stock price movement. The trading indicator gives hourly and/or daily buy & sell signals for all S&P 500 stocks based on online sentiment on Twitter. The stock price predictions are based upon various machine learning algorithms and have an accuracy as high as 60 percent with an average of 54 percent. The predictions take away extra noise in asset pricing, and can be used by investors as an additional trading indicator on top of fundamental analysis and technical analysis.

- Financial Sentiment API
Sentiment is hard to classify in financially themed Twitter messages, mainly because financial markets speak their own language of fear and greed. The Financial Sentiment API is specifically trained to deal with unstructured context and financial jargon, and has an accuracy of 84.3% on a binary scale and an accuracy of 76.8% on a three point scale. 

- Brand Sentiment API
Classify sentiment in social media messages surrounding brands. The algorithm is specifically tailored to brands, products & company information. It has an accuracy of 84.7% on a binary scale and an accuracy of 86.9% on a three point scale. ",sntmnt
